This is the first of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
created. Generally a bitmap if first produced by a program such as sym_strip, 
rect_in_rect, rect_cen_in_rect, circ_in_circ, circ_in_rect, 
generate_coupler_bitmap etc.

The checksum of the bitmap generated is compared to what is known to be 
the correct checksum using a program 'mycksum' which is a cut-down version of
the GNU program 'sum'. Using my own version avoids the need for the user to 
have the GNU textutils installed and avoids the possibility that they have
'textutils' installed but have another version of 'sum' (such as the one 
supplied by Sun with Solaris, which generates a different checksum. 

atlc is then run, generating a lot of files, including those with the 
extension .bmp, .txt and .bin. The checksum of the .bmp's and part of
the .txt file are checked. The .bin's are not, since they will be
dependent on the whether the machine is Big Endian (like Suns) or
Little Endian like PCs. It will also be too dependent on rounding
difference caused by the different FPUs in the different machines. 

Any failure to generate the correct checksums are noted. 

Any failure in an Xa-... where X is an integer will cause
Xb, Xc, Xd ...etc to fail. Any pass of Xa, but faiure of Xb will cause
all the Xc, Xd ... to fail. If both Xa and Xb pass, then hopefully Xc,
Xd etc will. However, Xd, Xe etc does not rely on the correct functioning of 
Xc. The Xc, Xd, ... only need Xa and Xb to pass, so Xc, Xd etc are
independent of each other. 

I would add that *most* of these checksums have been checked using the GNU
textutils on about 15 different computers, from PCs, to Suns to Dec etc.
However, there are a few:

2f-rect_in_rect.Ex.bmp.test
2h-rect_in_rect.V.bmp.test
3b-rect_cen_in_rect.txt.test
7a-generate_coupler_bitmap.bmp.test
8a-design_coupler.bmp.test

that have never been tested elsewhere. Failures can be expected on these
since a small change in how numbers are rounded can result in a
different bitmap or text file. However, the others have been
tested on so many that I doubt this situation will arrive. 

The only other reason I can think of a failure is that there is a difference
in the outout of 'mycksum' to the GNU utilites one, but that is
unlikely. So if any problems occur, check the checksum with the GNU
'sum' and see what that gives. If *any* failures do occur, please let me
know.
