This directory has a set of tests that generate checksums after files are
created. Generally a bitmap is first produced by a program such as sym_strip, 
create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect, create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect, 
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ, create_bmp_for_circ_in_rect, 
create_bmp_for_coupler etc.

The checksum of the bitmap generated is compared to what is known to be 
the correct checksum using a program 'mycksum' which is a cut-down version of
the GNU program 'sum'. Using my own version avoids the need for the user to 
have the GNU textutils installed and avoids the possibility that they have
'textutils' installed but have another version of 'sum' (such as the one 
supplied by Sun with Solaris, which generates a different checksum. 

atlc is then run, generating a lot of files, including those with the 
extension .bmp, .txt and .bin. The checksum of the .bmp's and part of
the .txt file are checked. The .bin's are not, since they will be
dependent on the whether the machine is Big Endian (like Suns) or
Little Endian like PCs. It will also be too dependent on rounding
difference caused by the different FPUs in the different machines. 
The size of some .bin files are checked. 

Any failure to generate the correct checksums are noted as a failure.
Not linking against the gsl library will cause failures. 

Any failure in an Xa-... where X is an integer will cause
Xb, Xc, Xd ...etc to fail. Any pass of Xa, but faiure of Xb will cause
all the Xc, Xd ... to fail. If both Xa and Xb pass, then hopefully Xc,
Xd etc will. However, Xd, Xe etc does not rely on the correct functioning of 
Xc. The Xc, Xd, ... only need Xa and Xb to pass, so Xc, Xd etc are
independent of each other.
