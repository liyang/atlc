This is a set of tests that check the integrety of the atlc
package. Tests are performed in various ways.

1) The checksums of some supplied files are checked. 
2) The checksums of some bitmap files generated by programs
in 'atlc' are compared to those expected. 
3) The length of some binary files is checked - no checksums
are tested for binary files, as it would be pointless. 
4) The results from some calculations with atlc are compared
to those expected. 

The checksum of the files checked is compared to what is known to be 
the correct checksum using a program 'mycksum' which is a cut-down version of
the GNU program 'sum'. Using my own version avoids the need for the user to 
have the GNU textutils installed and avoids the possibility that they have
'textutils' installed but have another version of 'sum' (such as the one 
supplied by Sun with Solaris), which generates a different checksum. 

SOME OF THE TESTS ARE KNOWN TO GIVE DIFFERENT RESULTS EACH
TIME THEY ARE RUN, THERE ARE:

7j-create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler.Ex.even.bmp.test
7k-create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler.Ey.even.bmp.test
11h-verify-checksum-of-created-test-coupler1.Ex.even.bmp.test
11i-verify-checksum-of-created-test-coupler1.Ey.even.bmp.test
