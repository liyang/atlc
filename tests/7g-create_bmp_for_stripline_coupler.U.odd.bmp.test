# This is one of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
# created. Generally a bitmap if first produced by a program such as create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline, 
# create_bmp_for_create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect, create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect, create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ, create_bmp_for_circ_in_rect, 
# create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler etc.

# The checksum of the bitmap generated is compared to what is known to be 
# the correct checksum using a program 'mycksum' which is a cut-down version of
# the GNU program 'sum'. Using my own version avoids the need for the user to 
# have the GNU textutils installed and avoids the possibility that they have
# 'textutils' installed but have another version of 'sum' (such as the one 
# supplied by Sun with Solaris, which generates a different checksum.
