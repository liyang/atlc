# This is the one of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
# created. Generally a bitmap if first produced by a program such as create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline, 
# create_bmp_for_create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect, create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect, create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ, create_bmp_for_circ_in_rect, 
# create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler etc.

# The checksum of the bitmap generated is compared to what is known to be 
# the correct checksum using a program 'mycksum' which is a cut-down version of
# the GNU program 'sum'. Using my own version avoids the need for the user to 
# have the GNU textutils installed and avoids the possibility that they have
# 'textutils' installed but have another version of 'sum' (such as the one 
# supplied by Sun with Solaris, which generates a different checksum. 

# atlc is then run, generating a lot of files, including those with the 
# extension .bmp, .txt and .bin. The checksum of the .bmp's and part of
# the .txt file are checked. The .bin's are not, since they will be
# dependent on the whether the machine is Big Endian (like Suns) or
# Little Endian like PCs. It will also be too dependent on rounding
# difference caused by the different FPUs in the different machines.
