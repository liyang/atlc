# !/bin/sh
# This is one of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
# created. Generally a bitmap if first produced by a program such as sym_strip, 
# rect_in_rect, rect_cen_in_rect, circ_in_circ, circ_in_rect, 
# generate_coupler_bitmap etc.

# In a few cases, the checksum is performed on a file that is 
# supplied with the package, rather than one that is 
# generated. 

# The checksum of the bitmaps generated is compared to what is known to be 
# the correct checksum using a program 'mymd5sum' which is a cut-down version of
# the normal md5 or md5sum command.  It does not print the filename 
# to stdout, as the normal version does. 

# Due to rounding errors, some systems do generate a different checksum on 
# one machines to another. Usually this is only a single pixel differing
# by one gray level. In this case, the 3 consequive bytes 301041, 
# 301042 and 301043 are 254 on a Cray Y-MP but 255 on a Sun. AS such, 
# in this case, more than one checksum is acceptable. 

# On Sun Ultra 80 353a368663a112d7e8f0af6a63df75f3
# On Cray YMP-EL 2a9644a0206c2314006e298f07aae233
