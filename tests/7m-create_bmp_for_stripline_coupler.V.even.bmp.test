# This is one of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
# created. Generally a bitmap if first produced by a program such as create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline, 
# create_bmp_for_create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect, create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect, create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ, create_bmp_for_circ_in_rect, 
# create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler etc.

# The checksum of the bitmap generated is compared to what is known to be 
# the correct checksum using a program 'mycksum' which is a cut-down version of
# the GNU program 'sum'. Using my own version avoids the need for the user to 
# have the GNU textutils installed and avoids the possibility that they have
# 'textutils' installed but have another version of 'sum' (such as the one 
# supplied by Sun with Solaris, which generates a different checksum. 

# atlc is then run, generating a lot of files, including those with the 
# extension .bmp, .txt and .bin. The checksum of the .bmp's and part of
# the .txt file are checked. The .bin's are not, since they will be
# dependent on the whether the machine is Big Endian (like Suns) or
# Little Endian like PCs. It will also be too dependent on rounding
# difference caused by the different FPUs in the different machines. 

# Any failure to generate the correct checksums are noted. 

# Any failure in an Xa-$top_builddir. where X is an integer will cause
# Xb, Xc, Xd $top_builddir.etc to fail. Any pass of Xa, but faiure of Xb will cause
# all the Xc, Xd $top_builddir. to fail. If both Xa and Xb pass, then hopefully Xc,
# Xd etc will. However, Xd, Xe etc does not rely on the correct functioning of 
# Xc. The Xc, Xd, $top_builddir. only need Xa and Xb to pass, so Xc, Xd etc are
# independent of each other. 

# I would add that these checksums have been checked using the GNU
# textutils on about 15 different computers, from PCs, to Suns to Dec etc.
# So they are okay and I would suggest any failures is a problem. 
# The only reason I can think of a failure is that there is a difference
# in the outout of 'mycksum' to the GNU utilites one, but that is
# unlikely. So if any problems occur, check the checksum with the GNU
# 'sum' and see what that gives. If any failures do occur, please let me
# know. email drkirkby@ntlworld.com and/or davek@medphys.ucl.ac.uk
