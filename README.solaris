1) Sun's make programme in /usr/ccs/bin/make is not able to compile this
properly, giving an error message like 

mksh: Fatal error in reader: = missing from replacement macro reference

Another problem found on the make in Solaris 2.5 is that it don't know
how to make acx_mpi.m4. That file is included in the distribution for
future use, but there is no reason for the program to do anything with
it. 

Use GNU make to build atlc. This is often installed on systems as gmake.
Other make versions like smake may work, but I've never tried them. 

2) If you have a copy of Sun's cc compiler, the following 
CFLAGS are suggested. Using Sun's compiler will give about a 25% reduction 
in run times. 

'-dalign -fns -fsimple=1 -xalias_level=basic -xdepend -xlibmil -xO5 -I/usr/local/include -R/usr/local/lib'

If you find a better set of options for Sun's cc, that still allow all
the tests to pass, then please let me know. 
 
3) pth does *not* need to be installed in configuring this for multiple
processors on a Sun. Sun has its own threaded library.

4) Someone has requested that 'atlc' be added to the www.sunfreeware.com
web site for Solaris 8 SPARC (which means it will almost certainly work on 
Solaris 9 too). This should happen at some time in the near future
(month or two).
