Sun's make programme in /usr/ccs/bin/make is not able to compile this
properly, giving an error message like 

mksh: Fatal error in reader: = missing from replacement macro reference

Use GNU make to build this. This is often installed on systems as gmake.
 
pthreads do *not* need to be installed in configuruing this for multiple
processors on a Sun, but you can use them if you wish. Sun has its own
threaded library.
