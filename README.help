If anyone can help advise me of sucess and/or failure on building a
threaded version of atlc on any platform other than

IBM's AIX
SGI's IRIX
Sun's Solaris
Redhat Linux on PC

I would appreciate it. Any indication of the amount the extra CPUs
improves performance would be nice too. Note that only the program
'atlc' and not any of the other half or dozen or so programs are written
to support multiple processors.
