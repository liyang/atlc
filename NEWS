NEWS for realease 4.3.2 on 12 June 2003.

A benchmark has been added, so that one can check the 
speed of execution. This shouuld also be able to gather
some hardware information such as
a) CPU type
b) FPU type
c) CPU speed
c) RAM 
d) Number of CPUs
e) Maximum number of CPUs support by system.

Currently, the above data has only been gathered on 
Solaris and Tru64, but some may work on other platforms.
