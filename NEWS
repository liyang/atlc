NEWS for realease 4.2.11 on  29/3/03.

A rather annoying bug has finally been found. The checksums of some of
the bitmaps generated changed a bit from tiem to time, for no apparent
reasson. It was found that some of the vaiables were being used
unitialised! Thanks to Sun's compiler, this was easy to find. 

Support for MPI (message passing interface), has been added, so a
network of computers can be used to solve a problem. This was added by
Patrick Kelsey <kelsey@ieee.org>. Apparently it works under Linux on a
PC but it won't work on my Sun Ultra 80 running Solaris 9.  As such,
this feature is not really working well, but anyone can feel free to
play with it. See the INSTALL file for a bit more iformation and also
run 'configure --help'. 


Putting bitmaps where there are electical shorts will now develope an error, 
rather than produce an incorrect result.         

The output from atlc run on all the bitmaps in the examples directory are 
included - they are small files and might be useful to people. 

Running the binary programs incorrectly will print a version number.
