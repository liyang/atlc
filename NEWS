NEWS for realease 4.4.3 on  11th September 2003.

Someone has done a Windoze port of atlc. Appently it took just 5
minutes, from start to finish. A single bug was found that prevented 
atlc compiling, but that was fixed - it needed a left brace removed. 
This had never been seen on a UNIX system, since the offending code 
was between a couple of #define's. 

I hope to have the Windows binaries up on the site very soon. 

It has been bought to my attention that bitmaps created with Photoshop
prior to version 7.01 could not be read by atlc. This was not a 
fault of Photoshop, but of atlc, so that bug has been fixed. 

A man page has been written for the small program 'sysdata'

Some data on the examples.html file has been corrected. 

The documentation is improved with typos removed and a general
improvement in documentation.
