NEWS for realease 4.4.1 on  4th September 2003.

I new program 'tests/sysdata' has been added, which
gets information about the hardware and presents it
quickly.

atlc is now better at gathering hardware information on
SGI systems running IRIX. 

atlc is now better at gathering hardware information on
BSD systems. This should include OS X, but is as yet 
untested. 

atlc no longer generates compiler warnings with gcc -Wall
on the files
create_bmp_for_rect_in_circ.c or
read_bitmap_file_headers.c
sysdata.c
try_solaris.c
so should no longer generate *any* compiler warnings, on
any files on any operating systems. If you get any
compiler warnings, let me know.
