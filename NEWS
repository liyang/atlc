NEWS for realease 4.2.8 on 11/1/03.
 
A new developer, Patrick Kelsey, has agreed to help. 

This is the probably last 4.x.y release, although there
may be a relase or two if bugs are found. Work is now
starting on version 5.

Version 5 will support MPI (message passing interface), 
but the 5.0.0 release is likely to have some bugs
(as all codes does I guess). The 4.x.y should be the 
more stable (at least initally) but hopefully the 
MPI support in version 5.x.y will be of use to  
someone who runs atlc a lot and has access to a network
of computers. 

Putting bitmaps where there are electical shorts will
now develope an error, rather than produce an incorrect
result.         

The output from atlc run on all the bitmaps in the 
example directory are included - they are small files
and might be useful to people. 

Running the binary programs incorrectly will print
a version number.
