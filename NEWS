NEWS for realease 4.4.0 on  30th August 2003.

atlc now runs on anything from a toy to a supercomuter! Yes, that is
right. An early version of atlc has been run on a Sony Playstation 2
games console and version 4.4.0 has been tested on the Cray Y-MP
supercomputer!! It has also been run on a very large number of other
UNIX systems, so is hopefully very portable. 

An option that was previously reccommended --enable-hardware-info
has been removed. It is now enabled by default, but can be   
over-ridden with --disable-hardware-info.
