NEWS for realease 4.4.2 on  5th September 2003.

Within a few hours of releasing 4.4.1, I realised
there was a bug that prevented it compiling on 
at least one BSD system. I'm hoping this prevents that
problem, but if not, add the option 
--disable-hardware-info and re-configure.

Added a system call to get the number of configured 
processors online in Linux. This seems to be undocumented
so it not without its risks, but it seems to work okay on the 
limited number of systems tested on.

NEWS for realease 4.4.1 on  4th September 2003.

I new program 'tests/sysdata' has been added, which
gets information about the hardware and presents it
quickly.

atlc is now better at gathering hardware information on
SGI systems running IRIX. 

atlc is now better at gathering hardware information on
BSD systems. This should include OS X, but is as yet 
untested. 

atlc no longer generates compiler warnings with gcc -Wall
on the files
create_bmp_for_rect_in_circ.c or
read_bitmap_file_headers.c
sysdata.c
try_solaris.c
so should no longer generate *any* compiler warnings, on
any files on any operating systems. If you get any
compiler warnings, let me know.
