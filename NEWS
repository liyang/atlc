NEWS for realease 4.4.1 on  4th September 2003.

This is a minor release, since the basic functionality
is unchanged since the last release 4.4.0, when there
were significant changes. This release will mainly benifit
those running IRIX or BSD UNIX (including Mac OS X)

atlc is now better at gathering hardware information on
SGI systems running IRIX. 

atlc is now better at gathering hardware information on
BSD systems. This should include OS X, but is as yet 
untested. 

atlc no longer generates compiler warnings with gcc -Wall
on the files
create_bmp_for_rect_in_circ.c or
read_bitmap_file_headers.c
sysdata.c
try_solaris.c
so should no longer generate *any* compiler warnings.
