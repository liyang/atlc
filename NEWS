The code has been changed slightly so that it compiles (and works) 
under Windows too. Previoulsy it compiled okay, but some small 
changes were needed, mainly related to reading binary files in and 
out. I'm grateful for the help of Randall DuCharme AD5GB for his 
help with some of that. 

WHILST THE CODE NOW RUNS UNDER WINDOWS, IT WILL NOT BE KEPT
UP TO DATE SO MUCH AS UNDER UNIX.

The code has been put onto CVS. This is completley new to me and
Randall, so some problems are likely to occur. This is
evident that there are three directories 

drk-root
sources
root

There should only be one, but they can't be removed on
SourceForge by me anyway. Anyway, hopfully it will allow for
the easiler development by two people.
