NEWS for realease 4.4.4 on  13th September 2003.

The main changes in this release are a those that 
allow the code to work under Windoze somewhat better
I hope, although I personally can't be bothered   
buiding Windoze binaries, I have tried to change the 
code to be compatable with Windoze where it is can
be done without affecting the UNIX code's peformance.

There are a couple of changes to make the documetation
to improve it.
