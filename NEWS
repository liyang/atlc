NEWS for realease 4.3.8 on  21st August 2003.

Some changes have been made to the tests so that when the benchmark 
runs it should not produce junk for the hardware information on any 
system. Previosly is could create a lot of junk, that was all wrong. 

It should now build on a system that needs errno.h for errno to be
defined. Previously, errno.h was not included, which one of the testers
found on his Suse Linux system. 

uname is now only called once from try_portable.c and the platform 
specific stuff computed elsewhere
