NEWS for realease 4.5.1 on  16th October 2003.

This is the sort of release I don't like to make. I have to disable two
features in atlc, since I have some concerns the results may not be
accurate in these cases.

1) When there are multiple dielectrics - there is clearly a problem
here. This does *not* affect configurations with single dielectrics,
but does (at least under some circumstances) affect multi-dielectric 
cases.     

2) There is a small possibility that the multi-threaded code may be
wrong, so I'm disabling the ability to built it multi-threaded. 
code for now. This will be re-instated soon. 


I woudld add I have every confidence in the results for single 
dielectrics and for single threaded code. EXTENSIVE testing has
shown this to be so. It should be impossible to get the wrong 
results with atlc now, as any attempt to use feature that I
have some suspicions about have been disabled.
