NEWS for realease 4.2.9 on 14/1/03.

This is only a bug fix of 4.2.8 - there are no new features.
Bug fixes include:

a) bug in the way the voltage array was updated, that could 
cause a slight error in calculations. It will be interesting
to see if the errors have dropped below the current levels
(maximum under 1%, rms about 0.4%)

b) The maximum ratio of height H to width w of a symmetical
stripline was previously 12, but has been extended to about
121. 

c) Some files that were in the atlc-4.2.8 distribution were
not in the CVS tree on Sourceforge, so have been added. 

d) The html file showing the location of some man pages
had the wrong filename and broken links.
