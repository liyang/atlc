The code has been changed slightly so that it compiles (and works) under
Windows too. Previoulsy it compiled okay, but some small changes were
needed, mainly related to reading binary files in and out.  I'm grateful 
for the help of Randall DuCharme AD5GB for his help with some of that. 

The code has been put onto CVS. This is completley new to me and
Randall, so some problems are likely to occur.
