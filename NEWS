NEWS for realease 4.3.8 on  21st August 2003.

Some changes have been made to the bests so that when
the benchmark runs it should not produce junk for
the hardware information on any system. Previosly
is could create a lot of junk, that was all wrong. 

uname is now only called once from try_portable.c
and the splatform specific stuff computed elsewhere
