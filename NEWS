NEWS for realease 4.2.11-alpha on 13/3/03.

This release has a bug, in that some of the tests, 
fail sometimes, pass on others. 

Although not tested well at all, and not reccomened
for general use, version 4.2.11-alpha supports
support MPI (message passing interface), 
but the release has bugs and does not work at all on
Solaris. 
(as all codes does I guess). The 4.x.y should be the 
more stable (at least initally) but hopefully the 
MPI support in version 5.0.0 will be of use to  
someone who runs atlc a lot and has access to a network
of computers. 

Putting bitmaps where there are electical shorts will
now develope an error, rather than produce an incorrect
result.         

The output from atlc run on all the bitmaps in the 
examples directory are included - they are small files
and might be useful to people. 

Running the binary programs incorrectly will print
a version number.
