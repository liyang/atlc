NEWS for realease 4.3.0 on 23 May 2003.

A bug, preventing atlc from runningt properly on multiple
processors has been fixed. This is the main change. 

atlc should no longer fail any test on a multi-processor
system configured with --with-threads. The algorithm used
for both single processor and multiple processor (i.e. 
threaded code is the same). 

The -t option to atlc, which sets the number of threads 
when configured for multiple processors can be set to 0
to use entirely the single-threaded algorithm. If set to
one, it will use the multi-threaded algoritm, but use
only one thread. If set to some other number, it will use
that number of threads and be optimal for the same number
of cpus. 

Support for distributed programming has been temporarily removed.
Someone else added the code, but since he is no longer involved in
the development, it is difficult for me to follow. So I'll remove
the MPI specific code and will re-implement this. 

A test has been added to make sure atlc can handle the -d option
