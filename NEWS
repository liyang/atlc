NEWS for realease 4.3.7 on  16th August 2003.

This is a bug release. Code had been tidied a bit so now gcc
-Wconversion does not complain about much code. I think there is a bug
in gcc-3.2.2 with this option, as it sometimes thinks code is wrong when it is
not.

Added some support for gathering hardware data under Linux. 

Removed MPI support, as its not working at all. 

Changes made to the code to remove the need for a type long long, 
which should make the code more portable.
