NEWS for realease 4.5.0 on  28th September 2003.

The main changes are
1) Improved documentation - including a couple of corrections

2) It is no longer necessary to have the gsl library present
as the single function that was called from the gsl library
has been integrated into atlc. 

3) I've removed my email address from all html files
and replaced it by a jpg that has the same information. 
This is to fool spammers.
