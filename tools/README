Here is a very quick implementation of the 'sum' command as part of GNU
textutils. It does not read from standard input, has no help, does not
list the size of a file ... All it does is generates a quick checksum
using the same algorithm as the GNU 'sum' command. By having it here, it
means the user does not need to install 'sum' or if it is installed, it
does not matter if aother version (such as Sun's is used).
