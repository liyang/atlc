Prior to verison 4.5.1, atlc could be configured to use 
mutltiple-threads to exploit multi-processors. This has 
been disabled, as I have some concerns the code may not 
be 100% correct and whilst is it unlikely, the results 
could be wrong. It is very unlikely, but its a chance
I don't want to take, so multi-threaded support has 
been disabled.
