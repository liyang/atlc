             IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR RELEASE 3.1.0  
             ----------------------------------

This, (version 3.1.0) of atlc, is the first version that supports coupled lines
(directional couplers) in addition to 2-wire transmission lines. This
has been quite a major extension to atlc, with the result a lot of the
documentation has been re-written.  The accuracy of the simulations on
couplers has not been fully evaluated, although initial results suggest that 
the impedances are calculated less accurately than with a conventional
two-conductor transmission line. 

The documentation has been extensively re-written for version 3.1.0, but
it is undoubtably less accurate than that of release 3.0.7. 

You may prefer to use 3.0.7 if problems are encountered, using the
documentation in atlc-3.0.7/docs/html-docs.

The documenation on the web at http://atlc.sourceforge.net will soon relate
to release 3.1.0, but will be a little less accurate for a while. 

This latest release, 3.1.0 does NOT support any dielectric other than a
vacuum for coupled lines (2-wire transmission lines can have any number
of dielectrics). Multiple dielectrics will certainly NOT work on coupled lines
and even a single uniform dielectric has not been checked. 

This is very much an interim release.
