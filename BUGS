The bitmap images generated by 'atlc' have not been
checked and are most problably wrong. Some work is 
needed to sort this out. 

The bitmaps produced by atlc can be different, when
run on the same computer with the same input file!
Two files have the same length, different checksums,
but look identical in gimp. There is clearly some 
problems occuring, but I don't know what. For that 
reason, a lot of the tests have been disabled. 

Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. 

Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 

'make check' wouild be better named 'make test'
as is more common. 

'make examples' would be nice.

The fact that some self-tests fail on threaded 
enabled 'atlc' is annoying. I know why, but can't
do a lot about it. 

There are no manual pages for several programs 

The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html
is wrong and was generated on an earlier release. However, it
makkes little difference - the meaning should be clear.

HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that 
are completely stupid. I can't work out why.
