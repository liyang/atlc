1.   There seems to be problems on SPARC running old versions of Linux 
     (Redhat 6.2, kernel 2.2.14-5.0smp) and Debian, when configured for
     multi-processor support.. I'm tempted to belive this is a bug in the 
     thread support on old versions of Linux. It's fine on newer versions on a 
     PC. 

2    Data on machines is only gathered properly on a few machines (Solaris
     Tru64 and HP-UX). On AIX, IRIX, Linux, *BSD, it is next to useless.

3.   Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a cpu-intenesive 
     re-run. The two example files ' Thread support on machines other than 
     Solaris is not known. I need to do more testing - preferably with 
     multi-processor machines. 

4.   There are no manual pages for several programs 

5.   The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html is wrong 
     and was generated on an earlier release. However, it makes little 
     difference - the meaning should be clear. 

6.   HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that are completely stupid.
     This is a problem with the program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so 
     anyway. 

7.   The script 'teston' does not seem to work to the local host, with instead 
     it giving a lot of failures. Wny ???
