There seems to be problems on SPARC running Redhat Linux
6.2, kernel  2.2.14-5.0smp, if compiled for multi-threaded use. 

Have received a 'pthread_create: Interrupted system call' 
error, but I think that is fixable and due to permissions problems. 
But more seriously, even when I fixed this problem in atlc.c, it still 
gives stupid results. 

The script 'teston' does not seem to work to the local host,
with instead it giving a lot of failures. Wny ???

Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. The two example files '
Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 

There are no manual pages for several programs 

The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html
is wrong and was generated on an earlier release. However, it
makes little difference - the meaning should be clear.

HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that 
are completely stupid. This is a problem with the 
program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway.
