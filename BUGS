It has been recently (since 1/5/03) that the bitamps generated by atlc
don't always have the same checksum. The binary files do however. This
rather points to the problem being in the material that writes the
bitmaps, rathe than anything else. I did (rather stupidly when one
thinks about it) try to see if the problem might be solved by re-writing
the code that finds the electric fields. Attemps at this made accuracy
poorer (for reasons I don't know), but also did not improve matters. I
tried using the dm5 checksum too, but that did not help, suggesting the
problem is not a fault in 'mycksum' command, but rather elsewhere. 

Things tried to solve this have included:
a) Using md5sum rather than mycksum, since it was possible my program
had a fault on it. But that would not appear to be the reason, since
differeing results arrive with md5sum too. 

b) Compared the binary files written. These are identical, but I can't
say these have ever been used, so it could just mean they always contain
the same junk. I need to check this, as that is a possibility.

c) Used 'memset' to start array with all zero's in them. 

d) Increased the number of zero's set in calculate_colour_data.c, but
his made no difference. One would not expect it too, since the memset
should have made the data all zero's anyway. But it was worth a try.

  image_dat[offset]=*blue; 
  image_dat[offset+1]=*green; 
  image_dat[offset+2]=*red; 
  /* Write some 0's beyond the data, as if the offset is not 0 next time,
  the content of the numbers in fron of the data are underfinedd
  */
  image_dat[offset+3]=0; 
  image_dat[offset+4]=0; 
  image_dat[offset+5]=0; 

e) Run SunVTS to stress the system and induce big amounts of ram
changes, but SunVTS won't run



Having the gsl library around causes a varaiable to be 
defined, but if this is not linked in, the program
refuses to compile

Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. 
The two example files '
Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 

'make check' wouild be better named 'make test'
as is more common. 

'make examples' would be nice.

The fact that some self-tests fail on threaded 
enabled 'atlc' is annoying. I know why, but can't
do a lot about it. 

There are no manual pages for several programs 

The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html
is wrong and was generated on an earlier release. However, it
makkes little difference - the meaning should be clear.

HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that 
are completely stupid. This is a problem with the 
program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway.
