Not working for directional couplers that have more than
one dielectric. See file WARNING.txt

Probably quite a few, but I'm not aware of any major ones.

Lack of consistancy on interface of some programmes like rect_in_rect,
sym_strip, etc. 

Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. 

Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 

'make check' wouild be better named 'make test'
as is more common. 

'make examples' would be nice.

The fact that some slef-tests fail on threaded 
enabled 'atlc' is annoying. I know why, but can't
do a lot about it.
