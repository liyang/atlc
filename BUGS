  1 Not every version of make will build atlc. GNU make will do, which
    is of course free. Sun's make will NOT. I think it is true to say 
    Sun's is the only version of make that is unsuitable, but if you find
    another one, use GNU make, but please advise me of the version. 

  2.There are two test failures on IBM's AIX operating system, using IBM's 
    compiler version 6.0 when compiled multi-threaded I've no idea of the
    source of these problems. Many pixels differ, but by a small amount. I 
    find it hard to believe this is rounding errors. 

  3.Data on machines is only gathered properly on a few machines (Solaris,
     Tru64, AIX and HP-UX). On IRIX, Linux, *BSD, it is next to useless. 

  4.If there is a version of the gsl library installed, but it is too old 
    (< version 0.8), then the linker will link in -lgsl. However, there will 
    be no gsl functions called, so *some* linkers (well the only one known is 
    on SGI's IRIX platform, will generate the warning message

    ld32: WARNING 84 : /usr/freeware/lib32/libgsl.so is not used for resolving any symbol. 

    This is harmless and may be ignored. The top-level configure.ac or the 
    m4/gsl.m4
    files need sorting out to correct this 

  5.There seems to be problems on SPARC running old versions of Linux 
    (Redhat 6.2, kernel 2.2.14-5.0smp) and Debian, when configured for
    multi-processor support. I'm tempted to believe this is a bug in the 
    thread support on old versions of Linux. It's fine on newer versions on a 
    PC. 

  6.The lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a 
    cpu-intensive re-run. 

  7.There are no manual pages for several programs 

  8.The error messages shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html are 
    wrong and were generated on an earlier release. However, it makes little
    difference - the meaning should be clear. 

  9.HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that are completely stupid. #
    This is a problem with the program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway.
