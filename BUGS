When the package is configured with threads (--with-threads)
or with MPI libary support (--with-mpi), the results differ
a little from those when not configured in this way. I hope
to update the algorithm, so this does not happen.

When configured with --with-mpi, the package seems to
fail misserablly on Solaris, but is apparnetly okay on
x86 PC. 

Have received a 'pthread_create: Interrupted system call' 
error whilse running on a Sun SPARCstation 20 with 2x125 MHz
HyperSPARC CPUs and 224 Mb of RAM running Linux woodpecker
2.2.14-5.0smp #1 SMP. (machine name 'woodpecker') when 
configured with the --with-threads option. This has
an SMP kernel, so it should have worked okay. Why ?????

The fact that some welf-tests fail on threaded enabled 'atlc' 
is annoying. I know why, but can't do a lot about it. 
other than to disable the tests, which is what is done 
now, by exiting with an exit code of 77 if the package
was configured with --with-threads. 

The script 'teston' does not seem to work to the local host,
with instead it giving a lot of failures. Wny ???

Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. The two example files '
Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 

There are no manual pages for several programs 

The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html
is wrong and was generated on an earlier release. However, it
makkes little difference - the meaning should be clear.

HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that 
are completely stupid. This is a problem with the 
program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway.
