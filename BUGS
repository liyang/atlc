  0 I was advised on the 15th of October 2003 there is a problem with atlc
    when there are multiple different dielectrics. As such, that has
    been disabled. 

  1 There is a theoretical risk of an error occuring when running
    atlc with multi-threaded coded on multi-processor systems. As
    such, the option to configure atlc for multiple processors has 
    been disabled. This will be re-enabled asap. 
  
  2 Not every version of make will build atlc. GNU make will do, which
    is of course free. Sun's make will NOT. I think it is true to say 
    Sun's is the only version of make that is unsuitable, but if you find
    another one, use GNU make, but please advise me of the version. 

  3.There are two test failures on IBM's AIX operating system, using IBM's 
    compiler version 6.0 when compiled multi-threaded I've no idea of the
    source of these problems. Many pixels differ, but by a small amount. I 
    find it hard to believe this is rounding errors. 
    1f-create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline.Ex.bmp.test
    6d-create_and_check_50ohm_201Pixel_high_symmetrical_stripline.test
    sometimes fails. Building multi-threaded tends to increase the 
    chances of a failure. 

  4.Data on machines is only gathered properly on a few machines (Solaris,
     Tru64, AIX IRIX and HP-UX). On Linux and  *BSD, it is next to useless. 

  6 Sometimes the CVS is not as current as it should be. 

  7.The lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a 
    cpu-intensive re-run. 

  8.There are no manual pages for several programs 

  9.The error messages shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html are 
    wrong and were generated on an earlier release. However, it makes little
    difference - the meaning should be clear. 

 10.HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that are completely stupid. #
    This is a problem with the program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway. 

 11 Sometimes documention in one file is out of date with documention in
    another. The web pages might not agree with those in docs/html-docs.
    or README's contradict each other. Where possible I've tried to   
    remember to update the ChangeLog and add a date to a file, but this
    does not always happen I'm afraid.
