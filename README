atlc - Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator.

Programme for analysing arbitrary transmission lines and directional
couplers. See HTML documentation in docs/html-docs

The sources are kept in src/non_gui, as a version with a GUI is planned
(not started yet). 

This is the directory layout. .
./docs 
./docs/html-docs         // As on the atlc web site at atlc.sourgeforge.net
./docs/html-docs/jpgs    // JPGS needed for the html docs above.
./docs/qex-december-1996 // A old paper I wrote, gives the theory.
./docs/theory            //  
./man                    // Standard Unix man pages.
./examples               // Some odd examples - most are created.
./src                    // Nothing much - see below
./src/non_gui            // All the C source code.   

After building (see INSTALL, which I've modified to be specific to
atlc) you *MUST* run 'make check' after running 'make'. Firstly,
it creates some files and checks them, but secondly it creates
all the exmxples files which are referred to in the
documentation, but which are too large to distribute. It is easier for
them to be created. I've kept the example files sepparte from the source,
but you might want to copy them to the src/non_gui directory. I tend to
do that, but felt it better not to when distributing the code. 

A Windows version (not graphical) can be found in an earlier distribution 
(3.0.7). I'm not going to update that, so get a Unix box if you want to use the latest versions. 

A version with a GUI that should run on Macs, Windoze and Unix is
planned. This however is expected to be some time from now. 

Please note I'm English, so spellings should be English and dates are in
the format Day/Month/Year, not the American way of Month/Day/Year. Hence
3/4/02 is the 3rd of April, and not the 4th or March.
