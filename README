atlc - Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator.

Program for analysing arbitrary transmission lines and directional
couplers. See HTML documentation in docs/html-docs

*********************************************************************
IMPORTANT - if altc won't compile on your system, configure with the 
option --without-hardware-info. It should then compile.

atlc is available as source code in a file atlc-version.tar.gz. Some
older binary releases are in existance but I would advise against 
using version of atlc prior to 4.6.0 for multiple dielectrics. 

See the file INSTALL if building from sources. Online documentation may
be found at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/

The sources are kept in src/non_gui, as a version with a GUI was
planned, but I don't think it will happen in the near future.

This is the directory layout. .
./docs 
./docs/html-docs         // As on the atlc web site at atlc.sourgeforge.net
./docs/html-docs/jpgs    // JPGS needed for the html docs above.
./docs/qex-december-1996 // A old paper I wrote, gives the theory.
./docs/theory            //  
./man                    // Standard UNIX man pages.
./examples               // Some examples
./tests                  // Self-tests and a benchmark.
./tools                  // Some tools that are useful for checkign the code
./tools/src              // Source code for above
./src                    // Nothing much - see below
./src/non_gui            // All the C source code.   
./tmp                    // Used during tests to dump data. 

After building (see INSTALL, which I've modified to be specific to
atlc) you should run 'make check' after running 'make'. 
One built, if you want to install the examples and binaries, run
'make install'. As the examples are large (~220 Mb) you might    
choose not to install them. In which case run 'make install-exec'
rather than 'make install'. If you later want to install the 
examples, run 'make install-data'
