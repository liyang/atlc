ATLC Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator.

Programme for analysing arbitrary transmission lines. See
HTML documentation in docs.

Then run the script src/tests. That will test your binaries. 

After making atlc (see install) run the script  src/tests to
test your binaries. 

Assuming the tests pass, then run the script examples/create to
will create some of the example bitmaps which are referred to in the
documentation, but which are too large to distribute. It is easier for
them to be created. 

A Windows version (not graphical) can be found in an earlier distribution 
(3.0.7). I'm not going to update that as often as the Unix version, so get a 
Unix box if you want the latest code.
