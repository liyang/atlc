atlc - Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator.

Program for analysing arbitrary transmission lines and directional
couplers. See HTML documentation in docs/html-docs

The sources are kept in src/non_gui, as a version with a GUI is planned
(not started yet). 

This is the directory layout. .
./docs 
./docs/html-docs         // As on the atlc web site at atlc.sourgeforge.net
./docs/html-docs/jpgs    // JPGS needed for the html docs above.
./docs/qex-december-1996 // A old paper I wrote, gives the theory.
./docs/theory            //  
./man                    // Standard Unix man pages.
./examples               // Some examples
./src                    // Nothing much - see below
./src/non_gui            // All the C source code.   
./tmp                    // Used during tests to dump data. 

After building (see INSTALL, which I've modified to be specific to
atlc) you should run 'make check' after running 'make'. 
One built, if you want to install the examples and binaries, run
'make install'. As the examples are large (~120 Mb) you might    
choose not to install them. In which case run 'make install-bin'
rather than 'make install'. If you later want to install the 
examples, run 'make install-data'

A Windows version (not graphical) can be found in an earlier distribution 
(3.0.7). I'm not going to update that, so get a Unix box if you want to use the latest versions. 

A version with a GUI that should run on Macs, Windoze and Unix is
planned. This however is expected to be some time from now. 

Please note I'm English, so spellings should be English and dates are in
the format Day/Month/Year, not the American way of Month/Day/Year. Hence
3/4/02 is the 3rd of April, and not the 4th or March.
