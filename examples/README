IMPORTANT - run the script 'create' in this directory, to prouduce some
of the example bitmaps. 

The following files may or may not be included with the release of atlc
that you have. To cut down download times, I generally don't distribute
every singe file, especially as some are over 20 Mb each (before
compression).  

The theoeritical impedances of some of these are listed in the
documentation in atlc-x.y.z/html-docs/accuracy.html

The files *.txt give the results when each of the files was run though
atlc. 

Note that the files with striplines in have the stripline only one pixel
high, placed centrally at the interface between the lower and upper
conductors. You will probably need to zoom in a lot to see it. The same
goes for the pcb type files - the strip is very thin.
