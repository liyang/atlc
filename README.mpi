This is the last release of atlc without the the addition of 
the Message Passing Interfact (MPI) support. The next release
release 5.0, will have support for MPI. Since 5.0 has some 
major changes, it is possible there are more bugs in that. 

I'm greateful for the help of Patrick Kelsey <kelsey@ieee.org>
for addint MPI support in version 5.0.0 for MPI.
