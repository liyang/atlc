<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
     This man page is not a complete set  of  documentation.  See
     the  html  files for more complete information. So far, I've
     not managed to install the html files  into  /usr/local,  so
     you  will  have  to  look into the atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs
     directory for them.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>sym_strip</B> is a pre-processor for <B>atlc</B>, the finite difference
     programme  that  is  used  to  calculate the properties of a
     two-conductor  electrical  transmission  line  of  arbitrary
     cross section. The programme <B>sym_strip</B> is used as a fast way
     of generating bitmaps (there is no need to  use  a  graphics
     programme),  for  a 1 pixel thick conductor of width w, cen-
     trally located inside a pair of groundplanes of width W  and
     separation  H. This has an exact analytical answer, when the
     inner is infinitely thin and the width W is infinitely wide.
     This   theoretical  impedance  is  also  calculated  by  the
     sym_strip. It is therefore used as a test of atlc.

     The parameters 'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions  of  the
     outer  conductor.  The outer dimensions of the inner conduc-
     tor are 'w' and 'c'. The inner conductor is assumed to  rest
     on  a dielectric (Er2) which is 'd' wide and outer conductor
     an the inner conductor is offset  'b'  from  the  left  hand
     sidewall  of  the  outer conductor. The whole region is sur-
     rounded by a dielectric of relative permittivity 'Er1'.  The
     dielectrics 'Er1' and then 'Er1' and 'Er2' will both be 1.0

     The bitmaps produced by <B>sym_strip</B> are 24-bit bit colour bit-
     maps,  as are required by <B>atlc</B>. Currenly sym_strip only pro-
     duces bitmaps with white (vacuum) dielectrics.
