<H1>Accuracy and run-times of <CODE>atlc</code></H1>
atlc is very accurate, as the data below will confirm. In a total of 31 tests performed on standard two-conductor transmission lines the maximum error was only 0.945 % and the rms error was 0.259  %. On a <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_coupler">directional coupler</a>, the maximum error was 0.927%, but the typical error was around 0.6%.  Read on if you wish to know how these figures were arrived at. 

<p>In order to test the accuracy of  <CODE>atlc</code>, some simple geometries were devised, for which there are known exact analytical solutions. Three cases were considered for two-wire transmission lines - the <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_coax">standard coaxial cable</a>, an off-centre or <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_eccentric_coax">eccentric coaxial cable</a> and a <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_symmetrical_strip">symmetrical strip transmission line</a>. For three-wires, which can be used to make a 4-port directional coupler, the  accuracy was compared using <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_coupler">two edge-on strip lines.</a>, as that is the only case I am aware of that has an exact analytical solution.

<H2><a name="Accuracy_coax" ><strong>Comparisons between atlc and a round coaxial cabl</strong>e</a></H2>
<p>

<img src="jpgs/coax2.jpg" ALT="coaxial line" align="left">One obvious case is the round coaxial cable, which has a well known and exact formula for its impedance. In the case of an vacuum dielectric, it is simply 
<br>
<STRONG>Zo=60.0*log<sub>e</sub>(D/d)</STRONG>
<br>
 where D is the inner diameter of the outer conductor and d is the outer diameter of the inner conductor. <br>
Circular conductors can never be defined exactly using a square grid, so differences between the exact answer and <CODE>atlc</code>'s answer are due to:
<UL>
<LI>Errors in representing a circle on a square grid</LI>
<LI>Errors in the method <COde>atlc</code> uses. </LI>
</UL>
<br>
Six coaxial cables were defined, which all had the same diameter outer conductor of 500 pixels, but the diameters of the inner conductors were made 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 pixels. All eccept one used a vacuum dielectric. The table below shows the theoetical results and the results computed by <code>atlc</code>.

Of course, one could constuct the a number of such transmission lines with a graphics package using its ability to draw circles, but getting the right diamters and offsets would be time confusming.

Note, due to their large size, the eccentric coax files are not distributed, but you could make them easily like this:
<pre><CODE>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 400 320 0 1 eccentric-a.bmp
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 500 400 40 1 eccentric-b.bmp
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 500 160 0 1 eccentric-c.bmp</CODE>
</pre>
etc. If you add the <code>-v</code> option to <code>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</code>, it will print the <strong>exact</strong> theoretical values for you too. 

<p>Note, since there is an exact answer to this geometry, even when the inner is offset, there is not a lot of point in spending seconds or minutes running <code>atlc</code> to come an approximate numerical answer, when you can compute an exact one in fractions of a second. However, using atlc to compute a few of these gives you confidence atlc is working properly. 

<H2><a name="Accuracy_symmetrical_strip" ><strong>Comparisions between atlc and a symmetrical strip transmission line</strong></A></H2>
Another obvious test is a symmetrical strip transmission line - see diagramme below. <p>
<img src="jpgs/symmetrical_strip.jpg" ALT="Symmetrical Strip Transmission Line"><p>
This has an exact analytical solution, dependent on the ratio of the 
width of the inner conductor w, to the distance between the two outer 
conductors H.  This assumes that the outer conductors extend to plus 
and minus infinity and the inner conductor is infinitely thin. This 
structure has the advantage of requiring no curves, so can be 
represented accurately with the square grid used in <CODE>atlc.</CODE> </p>
<p>
However, its impossible to have an inner conductor that is less than 1 pixel 
high and it is impossible to make the dimension W infinitely wide as it 
was take an infinite amount of disk space, RAM and CPU time. However, if 
the width W is made at least 4xH+w, then making it any larger does not 
seem to have much affect on the result.</p>
The <code>-i</code> option to <CODE>create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline</code>,
forces the width
W to be equal to 4 times the internal height plus the inner conductor's 
width w (unless the user specified a larger value of W). Hence, when
the <code>-i</code> option is used, a valid test of <code>atlc</code>'s 
accuracy can be made<br>
Without the <code>-i</code> option, you can made the width W and height 
H any value
you want above &gt;=5 pixels, although H must be odd, for the inner conductor
to fit equally between the two outer confuctors. As always, the bitmaps created  
are 10 pixels higher and 10 pixels wider, to enforce a green metallic boundary that is cleraly visable. 
<br>
<br>
<CODE>create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline -vv -i 0 201 290 50-201.bmp<br>
<br>
For this to be a valid test of atlc, the width should be<br>
infinite. Since you used the -i option (indicationg you<br>
want the width W to effectively infinite, W must exceed w + 4xH.<br>
Therefore W has been is set to 1134<br>
w=290 H=201 w/H=1.442786 xo=23.7538<br>
Zo is theoretically 49.989477 Ohms (assuming W is infinite)<br>
<br>
</code>
<p>
This structure, which has a w/H value of 1.442786, has a theoretical impedance close to 50 Ohms (49.989477 to be precise). atlc calculates this to be 49.8457 Ohms, an error of only 0.087%, when using a  grid 1134x201. Increasing the number of pixels to 2222x401,  the error actually increases to 0.191%. The reasons for this are belive to be known and could be removed but at lot higher CPU time. This problem will be addressed later, but for all practical purposes, the errors in atlc are insignificant.</p>

<p>
A programme <CODE>create_bmp_for_coupler</CODE> was written to automatically generate bitmaps given the height H between the groundplanes, the conductor widths w and spacing s. Ideally this needs simulating from -infinity to +infinity, but that is not practical. It was assumed that if the complete structure width W was equal to 2*w+s+8*H that would be adequate (this seemed <EM>about right</EM>, but I've no proof it is optimal). As well as producing a bitmap, <CODE>create_bmp_for_coupler</CODE>also calculate the theoretical values of impedance. In order to perform calculations of the theoetical impedance, <CODE>create_bmp_for_coupler </CODE> uses the GNU scientific library <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl">gsl</a>  for the elliptic integral calculations. Hence to obtain the theoretical values, gsl, available at <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl">http://sources.redhat.com/gsl</a>,  <STRONG>must</STRONG> be installed. The bitmaps will still be produced without the gsl library.</p>

Note, because of the need to simulate a large width W, these calculations are much slower than those above. The fact the simulation has to be done twice also adds to the time taken. A typical run, using the default bitmap size (18, which gives bitmap of 128 to 512kb), the time taken is approximately 2 minutes on a dual 300 MHz Sun Ultra 60. <br><br>
