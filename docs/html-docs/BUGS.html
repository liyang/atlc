If there is a verion of the gsl library installed, but it is too old
(< version 0.8), then the linker will link in -lgsl. However, there
will be no gsl functions called, so *some* linkers (well the only
one known is on SGI's IRIX platform, will generate the warning message<br>
<br>
ld32: WARNING 84 : /usr/freeware/lib32/libgsl.so is not used for resolving any symbol.
<br><br>
This is harmless and may be ignored. The top-level configure.ac or the m4/gsl.m4<br>
files need sorting out to correct this </LI>

There seems to be problems on SPARC running old versions of Linux
(Redhat 6.2, kernel  2.2.14-5.0smp) and Debian, when configured
for multi-processor support. I'm tempted to believe
this is a bug in the thread support on old versions of Linux. It's fine
on newer versions on a PC.

<li>
The script 'teston' does not seem to work to the local host,
with instead it giving a lot of failures. Wny ???
</li>

<li>
Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. The two example files '
Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 
</li>
<li>
There are no manual pages for several programs 
</li>
<li>
The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html
is wrong and was generated on an earlier release. However, it
makes little difference - the meaning should be clear.
</li>

<li>
HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that 
are completely stupid. This is a problem with the 
program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway.
