atlc does NOT run properly on AIX. So far its only been checked on AIX
5.2 using  IBM's C compiler version 6.0 on an IBM RS/6000 7025 F50
server. But it behaved <b>very badly</b> on that. Clearly the program <em>atlc</em> is not working right, although at least some of the support programs are
working.  What is up I don't know.

There seems to be problems on SPARC running old versions of Linux
(Redhat 6.2, kernel  2.2.14-5.0smp) and Debian, when configured
for multi-processor support.. I'm tempted to belive
this is a bug in the thread support on old versions of Linux. It's fine
on newer versions on a PC.

<li>
The script 'teston' does not seem to work to the local host,
with instead it giving a lot of failures. Wny ???
</li>

<li>
Lack of any way of changing brightness of images without a
cpu-intenesive re-run. The two example files '
Thread support on machines other than Solaris is 
not known. I need to do more testing - preferably
with multi-processor machines. 
</li>
<li>
There are no manual pages for several programs 
</li>
<li>
The error message shown in the files docs/htlm-docs/errors.html
is wrong and was generated on an earlier release. However, it
makes little difference - the meaning should be clear.
</li>

<li>
HTML versions of the man pages have diagrams that 
are completely stupid. This is a problem with the 
program 'man2html' I'm using - I think so anyway.
