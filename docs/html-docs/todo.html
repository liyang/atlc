<H1>To Do list..</H1>
Here is a list of the ways I would like to expand <COde>atlc</code>, in a rough order of time.
<OL>
	<LI>Implement a better way of enabling a user to change the contrast/brightness in an image. Current, this can only be done with the '<a href ="options.html">-f option</a> to <code>atlc</code>, but this requires a re-run of <code>atlc</code> to do this, which is hardly very useful, given <code>atlc</code> is so CPU intensive. There are faster ways of doing this, just from the binary files (example.E.bin, example.Ex.bin and example.Ey.bin)..<br><br></LI>
	<LI>Try other methods of thread syncronisation in the version of the programme that supports multiple CPUs. Currently, threads are created and destroyed to given syncronisation. I think there may be a faster method by the use of 'mutex variables', but this has not be tried.<br><br></LI>
	
<pre>
Usage: rect_in_rect  W H a b c w h Er1 Er2 accuracy_level filename

where W, H, a, b, c, w and h  are all in mm or all in
inches - they *must* use the same units!
Accuracy should be 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 10  which  sets the internal array size.
3 gives is pretty good accuracy - any more than 5 will take ages.

This could then be used to pipe its output to <code>atlc</code>, saving the need to create an intermediate bitmap file.

<LI>Improve support for coupled transmission lines. It is very weak at the present time.<br><br></LI>
	<LI>I'm considering adding support for <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solutions/hpc/dotcom.html">Sun's HPC</a>, which allows many machines on a network to act in parrallel to solve a problem. This is perhaps not needed on <COde>atlc</code>, since while it is cpu intensive, it is not massively so. <COde>atlc</code> already supports multiple CPUs, but supporting a network of CPUs is probably a bit over the top. However, I'm interested in such concepts, so might do it anyway. I once developed my own system for using a network of 24 computers for modelling light transport in human tissue. However, HPC is far more sophisticated than what I did.</LI>
</OL>

If anyone has any suggestions for how to improve <COde>atlc</code>, please <a href="mailto: drkirkby@ntlworld.com?subject=atlc%20-%20Arbitrary%20Transmission%20Line%20Calculator">email me</A>.
