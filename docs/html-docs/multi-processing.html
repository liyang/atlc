<H1>Multi-processing with atlc</H1>
</p>The executable program <CODE>atlc</CODE>, which is part of the <EM>atlc</EM> package of programs,  can be quite CPU intensive. This is especially troublesome if atlc is executed  a large number of times in an itterative loop, as the program <EM>desgin_coupler</EM> will do if asked to find the phyical dimensions of  a directional coupler.  </p>

To reduced execution time, the program atlc can be configured to support multiple processors This obviously requires a computer with more than one CPU, but also a POSIX compatable thread library. Most systems, including GNU/Linux, normally  have such a library installed, although a minimal setup of the operating system might well not have such a library present. You can if you wish try using the GNU Pth library at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/">http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/ </a>, although <em>atlc</em> has not been tested with Pth. In order to configure atlc as a multi-threaded program for use on multiple CPUs, use the <CODE>--with-threads</CODE> option to the <CODE>configure</CODE> script i.e. run
<br>
<CODE>
<br>
configure --with-threads<br>
make <br>
make check <br>
make install<br>
<br></CODE>
Again, if there are problems compiling or linking during the <code> make check</code> phase, you should try building with the <code>--disable-hardware-info</code>. The gathering of hardware data is especially useful on multi-processor machines, as it indicates some performance parameters. However, it might just cause compilation to fail on some systems, so it can be disabled.

See here <a href="building.html">for detailed building instuctions</a> which includes how to configure<EM> atlc</EM> with support for more than one processor.
