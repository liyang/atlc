You can quickly generate bitmaps for common geometries using the commands under 'Generate Bitmap'. This is faster than drawing them by hand in a Graphics package.
If you have a really odd shaped line you wish to analyse, draw its cross section in a graphics package and save the file as a colour bitmap. atlc can read the bitmap, as long as the colours are correct - see the helf files. 
To check whether your version of atlc is working 100% okay, read in a few of the provided bitmap files, compute their properties, save them to a file and compare the checksums of those files using Tools->Generate Checksum. 
If you have a very large number of transmission lines to analyse, you may prefer to use the older version, 'atlc_old' which does not have a graphical user interface, but is command line driven. 
For some simple geometries, including a coaxial line with the inner conductor off-centre, there are exact analytical expressions for impedance, capacitance etc. In this case, it is faster and more accurate to use the Calculate->Round Coaxial Cable or similar.
altc is *not* capable of computing the loss in transmisison lines. 
altc is capable of computing the odd and even mode impedances, Zodd and Zeven of a directional coupler. From those values and the length of the coupling region, it is possible to compute the directivity, coupling factor, return loss etc of a coupler. You do however need other software, such as 'Puff' to do this. 
Did you know atlc does not need to know the exact dimensions of your transmission line - only the relative ones. It make no difference to the impedance if all dimensions are scaled by the same factor. 
atlc will support multiple processors on a Unix machine, if you have a thread library (pthreads or pth for instance) and configure with --with-mp on the command line.
