NEWS for realease 4.2.10 on 30/1/03.

Main news is that a bug that caused crashes under Windoze
ZP has been removed from setup_arrays.c This was potntially
serious and could have caused a crash under any operating 
system. I don't know why it was not spotted before.

Some changes to the documention, with better spelling
(one day I'll use an HTML enitor with a spellchecker 
as Bluefish's does not seem to work for me). 

Added Sourceforge logo on many pages that did not have it 
before.
