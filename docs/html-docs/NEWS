Added options -s and -S in 'atlc' to enable the bitmap (.bmp) and binary
(.bmp) files to not be written. The default is to write these files. 

Remove options to write data to a text file and append data to
a text file from atlc. Changes meant it got more difficult
to implement and there seems little point when > and
>> do those functions.

Added the program 'create_bmp_for_coupled_microstrip' which does
exactly what the name says. Run it to see what options and 
command line arguments it expects, as there is no man page at 
the minute. 

*ALL* the files that create bitmaps have been renamed to create_bmp_for_xyz,
where xyz determines the geometry. There are now the following files
for creating bitmaps:

create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ
create_bmp_for_circ_in_rect
create_bmp_for_coupled_microstrip
create_bmp_for_coupler
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect
create_bmp_for_rect_in_circ
create_bmp_for_rect_in_circ.c
create_bmp_for_sym_strip

Added program 'find_optimal_dimensions_for_microstrip_coupler' which does 
an exhaustive search of different geometires for microstrip couplers.
