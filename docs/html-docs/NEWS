This is a bug release. Code had been tidied a bit so now gcc
-Wconversion does not complain about much code. I think there is a bug
in gcc-3.2.2 with this option, as it sometimes thinks code is wrong when it is
not.

Remove the --with-extra-benchmark-data, listed under Optional Packages,
as it was not an optional package at all. The option --enable-hardware-info
does this job, but is listed in the right section (Optional Features:
), rather than 'Optional Packages'
