<H1><COde>atlc</code> - Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator.</H1>
The programme <COde>atlc</code> calculates the impedance of two or three wire electrical transmission lines of totally arbitrary cross section, using a numerical technique called <EM>finite difference</EM>. The conductors can be coaxial, run side by side, or in just about any configuration you can think of. The diagrammes below shows 3 types of 2-wire  transmission lines and a directional copuler, all of which may be analysed. In each diagramme, one conductor is shown red, the other conductor shown green and in the case of a coupler, the third conductor is shown blue. The dielectrics are shown in a few other colours, with white being a vacuum and turquoise being a dielectric with an effective permittivity of 4.8 (about the same as fibreglass PCB).

The programme  <COde>atlc</code> needs to know the cross section of the transmission line. This cross section is stored in a data file, which happens to be a Windows bitmap file.  This bitmap file is then read by <COde>atlc</code> There are two ways to generate the bitmap for <COde>atlc</code>. 
<OL>
        <LI> As you might expect, you can draw the transmission line's cross-section in a graphics programme such as <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</A>, <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</A>, Windows <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Paint</A> Corel Photopaint etc.  The programme must be able to save images as bitmap (.BMP or .bmp) files, in 24-bit (true colour) mode The graphics programme can run under whatever operating system you like.  If for example you have some U-section brass and some hollow rectangular tube, and wanted to know the properties of a transmission line formed from these, you might draw something like this, and save it as a file, which we might call <CODE>ushape.bmp</CODE><br><br></LI>
       <img src="jpgs/ushape.jpg" ALT="U-section" > <br><br>
	<LI> In the case of simple cross-sections, the bitmaps can be generated automatically. Currently only one such programme has been written, called <EM>rect_in_rect</EM>, which is able to automatically generate a bitmap for any rectangular conductor, surrounded by any other rectangular conductor, with no more than 2 dielectrics. One dielectric must like under the centre conductor. Any of the following may be generated quickly with <EM>rect_in_rect</EM>  Using rect_in_rect is very fast - much faster than generating the bitmaps with a graphics programme, but complex cross sections can only be generated with the aid of a
	graphics programme </LI>

A unix computer, with a <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</A> or other C compiler, is needed  to compile and run <COde>atlc</code>. The programme should compile very easily and quickly. Being rather CPU intensive, <COde>atlc</code> has been written to support multiple processors if available. Here is an example of using atlc, with the file <CODE>ushape.bmp</CODE> being drawn by a graphics programme. <br>

It will be seen that <COde>atlc</code> makes several estimates of the transmission lines properties, each subsequent one being closer to the true value. (normally only the final result is shown, but the -v option added above causes <COde>atlc</code> to print intermediate results). 
<br><br>
Here's an example of using <EM>rect_in_rect</EM> to generate a bitmap The programme needs 11 parameters on its command line, which are described fully elsewhere. For now, just accept that these 11 parameters describe a transmission line. The output of <EM>rect_in_rect</EM> is redirected to the file <CODE>ex2.bmp</CODE>, which is then read by <COde>atlc</code>
