The bitmap files do not show quantitative data - ie the numbers are optimised to look okay, rather than to be scientifically rigorous.<p>
The binary files show similar data to the bitmaps, but in a more scientific way. They show the electric field in volts/pixel (.Ex.bmp, .Ey.bmp and .E.bmp) and voltage (.V.bmp)  assuming one conductor is earthed to 0v (the green one) and the other is at +1V (the red one). If your two conductors have a real voltage difference of V between them, the data file shows a value of E_data V/m, the dimensions of your transmission line are X mm across and the number of pixels in the x-direction allocated for the transmission line is N, then the true field strength that will be achieved in practice is 
E_real=E_data * N / X        (V/mm)<p>
