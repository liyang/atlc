     <B>create_coupler_bitmap</B> - bitmap generator  for  coupler  with
     thin  striplines  between  two  infinitly  wide groundplanes
     (part of <B>atlc</B>)

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>create_coupler_bitmap</B> is a pre-processor for <B>atlc</B>, the  fin-
     ite  difference programme that is used to calculate the pro-
     perties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission
     lines    of   arbitrary   cross   section.   The   programme
     <B>create_coupler_bitmap</B> is used as a fast  way  of  generating
     bitmaps  (there is no need to use a graphics programme), for
     a pair of 1 pixel thick conductors of width w, spaced a dis-
     tance  s apart, inside a pair of groundplanes of  separation
     H. This has an exact analytical answer, when  the  inner  is
     infinitely  thin and the overall width W is infinitely wide.
     This theoretical impedance  is  calculated  and  printed  to
     stderr if:
     a) The -v option is given on create_coupler_bitmap's command
     line. AND
     b) create_coupler_bitmap was linked against the gsl  library
     at http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/

     The overall width W is calculated  internally  to  be  large
     enough that making it any larger will have negligable effect
     on the results.  The dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.

     The bitmaps produced by <B>create_coupler_bitmap</B> are 24-bit bit
     colour bitmaps, as are required by <B>atlc</B>.

     <B>-b</B> <B>bitmapsize</B>
     is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so  the  accuracy
     to which atlc is able to calculate the coupler's properties.
     The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally  18  although
     this     can     be    set    at    compile    time.    (see
     'DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE' in definitions.h).  The  value
     can  be  set  anywhere from 6 to 28. The size of bitmap pro-
     duced will be between 2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1),
     so  if  its  set to 28 the bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb,
     which would take an eternity to compute.

     <B>-v</B>
     Print some extra data to stdout on the theoetical  impedance
     of the structure. This is useful to compare with the numeri-
     cal result from <B>atlc</B>
