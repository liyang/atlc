<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</B>  is  a  pre-processor   for
     <B>atlc</B>, the finite difference programme that is used to calcu-
     late the properties of a two and three conductor  electrical
     transmission lines of arbitrary cross section. The programme
     <B>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</B> is used as a  fast  way  of
     generating  bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics pro-
     gramme), for a pair of 1 pixel thick conductors of width  w,
     spaced  a distance s apart, inside a pair of groundplanes of
     separation H. This has an exact analytical answer, when  the
     inner  is  infinitely thin and the overall width W is infin-
     itely wide. This theoretical  impedance  is  calculated  and
     printed to stderr if:
     a)      The      -v      option      is       given       on
     create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler's command line. AND
     b) create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler was linked  against  the
     gsl library at http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/

     The overall width W is calculated  internally  to  be  large
     enough that making it any larger will have negligable effect
     on the results.  The dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.

     The bitmaps produced by <B>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</B> are
     24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as are required by <B>atlc</B>.

     <B>-b</B> <B>bitmapsize</B>
     is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so  the  accuracy
     to which atlc is able to calculate the coupler's properties.
     The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally  18  although
     this     can     be    set    at    compile    time.    (see
     'DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE' in definitions.h).  The  value
     can  be  set  anywhere from 6 to 28. The size of bitmap pro-
     duced will be between 2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1),
     so  if  its  set to 28 the bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb,
     which would take an eternity to compute.

     <B>-v</B>
     Print some extra data to stdout on the theoetical  impedance
     of the structure. This is useful to compare with the numeri-
     cal result from <B>atlc</B>
