<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
     This man page is not a complete set  of  documentation.  See
     the  html  files for more complete information. So far, I've
     not managed to install the html files  into  /usr/local,  so
     you  will  have  to  look into the atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs
     directory for them.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>create_bmp_for_symmetical_stripline</B> is a  pre-processor  for
     <B>atlc</B>, the finite difference programme that is used to calcu-
     late the properties of a two-conductor electrical  transmis-
     sion   line   of  arbitrary  cross  section.  The  programme
     <B>create_bmp_for_symmetical_stripline</B> is used as a fast way of
     generating  bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics pro-
     gramme), for a 1 pixel thick conductor of width w, centrally
     located inside a pair of groundplanes of width W and separa-
     tion H. This has an exact analytical answer, when the  inner
     is  infinitely thin and the width W is infinitely wide. This
     theoretical   impedance   is   also   calculated   by    the
     create_bmp_for_symmetical_stripline. It is therefore used as
     a test of atlc.

     The parameters 'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions  of  the
     outer  conductor.  The outer dimensions of the inner conduc-
     tor are 'w' and 'c'. The inner conductor is assumed to  rest
     on  a dielectric (Er2) which is 'd' wide and outer conductor
     an the inner conductor is offset  'b'  from  the  left  hand
     sidewall  of  the  outer conductor. The whole region is sur-
     rounded by a dielectric of relative permittivity 'Er1'.  The
     dielectrics 'Er1' and then 'Er1' and 'Er2' will both be 1.0

     The bitmaps produced by  <B>create_bmp_for_symmetical_stripline</B>
     are  24-bit  bit  colour  bitmaps,  as are required by <B>atlc</B>.
     Currenly create_bmp_for_symmetical_stripline  only  produces
     bitmaps with white (vacuum) dielectrics.
