<H1>Using atlc with coupled lines</H1>
Starting with version 4.0.0 of atlc, coupled lines can be analysed too. The support for coupled lines is not finished yet, and some bugs do remain. However, it is possible to calculate the properties of a pair of coupled lines in vacuum. Mixed dielectric, or any dielectric other than a vacuum is not currently supported. <p>Consider the transmission lines below, which has three metal conductors - a ground shown in green and the two inner conductors shown (shown red and blue) coupled together. <p><img src="jpgs/coupler.jpg" ALT="coupled lines">
<p>Such a structure has two characteristic impedances - an odd mode impedance Zodd and an even mode impedance Zeven. If the structure is drawn in red, blue and green, atlc will interpret this as a coupler and compute both impedances.

Note that atlc first computes the odd mode impedance, then on a second run computes the even mode impedance. The characteristic impedance is Zo=sqrt(Zodd*Zeven), so this is also computed on the second run. The accuracy of the calculation of odd and even mode impedances in couplers is discussed in the <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_coupler">accuracy section</a>. <p>
Later version of atlc will include some software to make use of the impedance values to calculate the properties of a directional coupler, although you should be able to use these in the free versions of spice or pspice. I have not tried that I must admit. There is also a cheapish ($10) programme called Puff available from <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mmic/puffindex/puffE/puffE.htm">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mmic/puffindex/puffE/puffE.htm </a> . That would certainly allow such calculations. There's a Unix verison too at <a href="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/puff.html">http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/puff.html.</a>  Puff is very good. A combination of atlc to find the electrical properties (Zo, Zodd Zeven etc) of transmission lines and Puff to simulate the properties (coupling factor, directivity, frequency response etc) given those parameters, should be very useful. <p>
