<H1>Coupled transmission lines</H1>
Unlike a standard two-conductor transmission line, such as coaxial cable that has a ground and  one other conductor, a  transmission line with 3 conductors forms a directional coupler. A directional coupler has 2 characteristic impedances - an odd-mode impedance Zodd and an even-mode impedance Zeven. <p>
The support for coupled lines is not completely finished  yet. However, it is possible to perform most tasks one would want to do with such a program. <STRONG>From a user's specification of a frequency response and coupling factor of a directional coupler, it is now possible to generate a physical layout that will have those specifications!</STRONG>. It is hoped this will be useful.

 although the shape is in practice quite a practical one to use for air-spaced lines. In fact, most people would consider it the easiest directional coupler to make for such situations. <p>However, <CODE>design_coupler</CODE> can  <STRONG>not</STRONG> be used to fully automate the process of designing directional couplers on PCBs, but other methods exist to make that job easier. Some manaul and fairly tedious work is needed to design a directional coupler on a PCB having the properties (frequency response, coupling factor) that you want. However, it can be done with the aid of the package of programs provided in <EM>atlc</EM>. <p>
	<LI><a href = "#given">Determine the properties of an arbitrary directional directional coupler, given its physical dimensions. </a> After dawing a bitmap of the directional coupler's physical dimensions with a graphics package, then using the program <CODE>atlc</CODE>, it is possible to calculate the capacitance per m, inductance per m, mode impedances, etc of an arbitrary shaped directional coupler. The directional coupler can have any shape of conductors and any number of dielectrics. From the data obtained from <CODE>atlc</CODE> it is possible to compute the properties of the directional coupler.  <p>It is not currently possible to design an arbitrary shaped directional coupler to have the properties you need., using a fully automated process. It is hoped at a later date to allow the process to be fully automated for PCB based directional couplers and perhaps some other common designs. That process will probably be fairly computationally expensive.</LI><p>

<p>Consider the transmission lines below, which has three metal conductors - a ground shown in green and the two inner conductors shown (shown red and blue) coupled together. <p><img src="jpgs/directional coupler.jpg" width="400" ALT="coupled lines">
<p>Such a structure has two characteristic impedances - an odd-mode impedance Zodd and an even-mode impedance Zeven. If the structure is drawn in red, blue and green, <CODE>atlc</CODE> will interpret this as a directional coupler and therefore computes both impedances.

Note that atlc first computes the odd-mode impedance, and then on a second run computes the even-mode impedance. The characteristic impedance is Zo=sqrt(Zodd*Zeven), so this is also computed on the second run. The accuracy of the calculation of odd and even-mode impedances in directional couplers is discussed in the <a href="accuracy.html#Accuracy_directional coupler">accuracy section</a> <p>

<p>
Later version of atlc will include some software to make use of the impedance values to calculate the properties of a directional directional coupler, although you should be able to use these in the free versions of spice or pspice. I have not tried that I must admit. There is also a cheapish ($10) programme called Puff available from <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mmic/puffindex/puffE/puffE.htm">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mmic/puffindex/puffE/puffE.htm </a> . That would certainly allow such calculations. There's a GNU/Linux verison too at <a href="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/puff.html">http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/puff.html.</a>  Puff is very good. A combination of atlc to find the electrical properties (Zo, Zodd Zeven etc) of transmission lines and Puff to simulate the properties (coupling factor, directivity, frequency response etc) given those parameters, should be very useful. <p>
