<LI><EM>atlc</EM> is a work in progress and sometimes there are differences between what it says in one part of the documentation and what it says elesewhere. If you find such at case, please e-mail me at <a mailto: "drkirkby@ntlworld.com">drkirkby@ntlworld.com<a/> and let me know and I'll advise which is correct and update the documentation</LI>
<LI> There is a <a href="../qex-december-1996/atlc.pdf">paper</a> that you may read on atlc that was written in 1998. atlc has changed a lot since then, but it might give you some idea of the theory behind it all</LI>
