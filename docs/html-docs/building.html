<BODY>

<H1>Building <COde>atlc</code> from sources</H1>
<p><EM>atlc</EM> is highly portable program and should run on any UNIX system and some non-UNIX systems. </P>
An early version for <EM>atlc</EM> forms part of the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>  project and has been ported to <a href=" ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/cad/atlc/README.html">23 different systems</a>, including the Acorn 32, Amiga, Arm32, Atari, Cobalt, Dec Alpha, HP 300, i386 PC, Mac 68000, Power PC, Sun SPARC, VAX etc. <STRONG><EM>atlc</EM> has even been run on a Sony Playstation 2!!</STRONG>.  In addition to the systems running NetBSD UNIX, <EM>atlc</EM> has been run on the following operating systems
<OL>
	<LI>Solaris 2.5, 8 and Solaris 9 for SPARC</LI>
	<LI>Solaris 8 for Intel</LI>
	<LI>Linux 2.4.17 for a Dec Alpha </LI>
	<LI>Tru64 UNIX 5.1B on a Dec Alpha 600a Personal Workstation</LI>
	<LI>Redhat 7.2 Linux on PC</LI>
	<LI>Redhat 6.2 on SPARC<LI>
	<LI>Debian 3.0 Linux on SPARC</LI>
	<LI>NetBSD 1.6 on SPARC</LI>
	<LI>OpenBSD 
	<LI>x86 PC's run Windoze 98 and NT</LI>
</OL>
To install <EM>altc</EM> you should download the souce code from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/atlc/"><COde>atlc</code>'s download area on SourceForge.</A> It is preferable to also have following software too, although none, apart from a compatible version of <CODE>make</CODE>, are essential. 
<OL>
	<LI>The <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/">GNU scientific library (gsl).</a> While not essentail, this is <STRONG>highly reccomended</STRONG>.</LI>
	<LI><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>, sometimes installed as <CODE>gmake</CODE>. Sun's version of make in <CODE>/usr/ccs/bin/make</CODE> is <STRONG>not</STRONG> suitable, although I don't know about other versions of make. The GNU one works fine. </LI>
	<LI>If you have a system with more than one CPU, <EM>atlc</EM> can be configured to use any number of CPUs in parallel to speed execution, using a POSIX compatable thread library, or pthreads. Sun's Solaris implementation works fine, but any other POSIX library should work. If you have multiple CPUs and don't  have a thread library, install  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth">GNU Portable Threads</A>,. <STRONG>If your computer has only one CPU, there is no point in building atlc to use multiple threads, as it will slow the program down</STRONG>.</LI>
	<LI>If you have access to a distributed set of computers and want to put a <STRONG>lot</STRONG> of effort in, you might like to help develop an MPI version of atlc. In which case, install the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/indexold.html">MPICH library</A>. This will enable some tests to check the MPI implementation, but will not do anything useful to atlc now. Hence for 99.999% of users, installing the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/indexold.html">MPICH library</A> would be a waste of time.

Extract the compressed file, using gunzip, or gzip -d.
<PRE>% gzip -d atlc-X.Y.tar.gz
% tar xvf atlc-X.Y.tar
% cd atlc-X.Y
% ./configure
% make
% make check  <STRONG> // This is very important, as it checks the binaries.</STRONG>
</PRE>
If you have multiple CPUs, add the option --with-threads to <CODE>configure</CODE> before running <CODE>make</CODE>. <br><p>
A total of 89 self-tests are performed in the <CODE>make check</CODE> stage.  <strong>No tests should fail</strong> but several will be skipped. Four tests make use of the t <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/">gsl library</a> and so will be skipped unless that is present. Two tests are used to check the operation of the POSIX threads, so will be skipped unless configured with <CODE>--with-threads</CODE>. One test checks the operation of the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/indexold.html">MPICH library</A>, so will be skipped unless <CODE>configure --with-mpi</CODE> is run. 
<br><br>
Note, you can <strong>not</strong> run <br>
 <CODE>% configure --with-mpi --with-threads</CODE> <br>as these options are mutually exclusive. Because of this, at leasat one test will always be skipped. <br><br>
Finally you can install the software if you wish. 
<PRE>
% su
# make install. </PRE>
The<CODE> make install</CODE> stage will install:
<OL>
	<LI>The executable programs (by default to<CODE> /usr/local/bin</CODE>)</LI>
	<LI>The man pages (by default to <CODE>/usr/local/man/man1</CODE>)</LI>
	<LI>Some HTML formatted documentation (generally similar to that on the  <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/">atlc website</a>. By default these are installed to<CODE> /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs</CODE>.
	<LI>A copy of a paper published on atlc back in the December 1996 issue of QEX. That along with the C source for this very early version is installed to<CODE> /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/qex_december_199</CODE>6</LI>
	<LI>Some example files (by default to<CODE> /usr/local/share/atlc/examples</CODE>)</LI>
</OL>
<br>

To build atlc with support for distributed processing using the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/indexold.html">MPICH library</A>, run:
<pre>
% configure --with-mpi=/path_to_your_mpi_library
</pre>
There are several other options to the configure script, which can be obtained by running <CODE>configure --help</CODE>
