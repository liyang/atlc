TODO List

Here is a list of the ways I would like to expand atlc, in a rough order of time. 

  1.Implement a better way of enabling a user to change the 
    contrast/brightness in an image. Current, this can
    only be done with the '-f option to atlc, but this 
    requires a re-run of atlc to do this, which is hardly
    very useful, given atlc is so CPU intensive. There are 
    faster ways of doing this, just from the binary files
    (example.E.bin, example.Ex.bin, example.Ey.bin, example.U.bin, 
    example.V.bin and example.Er.bin)..

  2.Try other methods of thread syncronisation in the version of atlc 
    that supports multiple CPUs. Currently,
    threads are created and destroyed to give syncronisation. 
    I think there may be a faster method by the use of
    'mutex variables', but this has not be tried.

  3.Get the program 'generate_bmp_for_rect_in_circ' working.

  4 Get a decent GUI. 

If anyone has any suggestions for how to improve atlc, please email me.
