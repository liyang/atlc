To Do list..

Here is a list of the ways I would like to expand atlc, in a rough order of
time. 

  1.Improve consistancy amonst the programmes rect_in_rect,
    rect_cen_in_rect, rect_in_circ, circ_in_rect, make_coupler and
    sym_strip. Most write to standard output, some write to a file given
    on the comand line, some take integer arguments, some take floats
    etc. It's all a bit confusing.

  2.Improve support for coupled transmission lines. It is very weak at
    the present time,being unable to handle any dielectric other tthan a
    vacuum and not being able to give any images showing the fields,
    energy or whatever. Additions may include some software to make
    use of the impedance values to calculate the properties of a
    directional coupler, although you should be able to use these in the
    free versions of spice or pspice. I have not tried that I must admit.
    There is also a cheapish programme called Puff available from
    http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mmic/puffindex/puffE/puffE.htm . That
    would certinaly allow such calculations. There's a Unix verison too
    at http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/puff.html 

  3.Implement a better way of enabling a user to change the
    contrast/brightness in an image. Current, this can only be done with
    the '-f option to atlc, but this requires a re-run of atlc to do
    this, which is hardly very useful, given atlc is so CPU intensive.
    There are faster ways of doing this, just from the binary files
    (example.E.bin, example.Ex.bin, example.Ey.bin, example.U.bin,
    example.V.bin and example.Er.bin)..

  4.Try other methods of thread syncronisation in the version of atlc
    that supports multiple CPUs. Currently, threads are created and
    destroyed to give syncronisation. I think there may be a faster
    method by the use of 'mutex variables', but this has not be tried.

If anyone has any suggestions for how to improve atlc, please email me.
