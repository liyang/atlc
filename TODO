1) Determine if there is a systematic error, which results in calculations 
being a fraction of 1% too high on Zo.  I would expect them always to be low, 
so this is a little strange. Estimation of Zo *always* rises, as it
approaches the true value. It should not overshoot as it appears to do.

2) *Possibly* support calcultion across a network of computers. Currently 
multiple processors on the one computer are supported, but I might extend 
this to a network of computers - at least for Solaris machines. 

3) Make rect_in_circ work (programme for computing Zo of rectangular 
conductors inside circular ones). The man page for it exists, but the
code does not.
