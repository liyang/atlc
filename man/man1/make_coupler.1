.SH NAME
\fBmake_coupler\fR - bitmap generator for coupler with thin striplines between two infinitly wide groundplanes (part of \fBatlc\fR)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmake_coupler [-C] [-b bitmapsize] [-v] H w s\fR
.br
.SH WARNING
\fBmake_coupler \fR prints binary output to the standard output and will
screw your terminal unless you redirect it. See the examples below. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmake_coupler\fR is a pre-processor for \fBatlc\fR, the finite difference 
programme that is used to calculate the 
properties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission lines of arbitrary 
cross section. The programme \fBmake_coupler\fR is used as a fast way of
generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics programme), for a
pair of 1 pixel thick conductors of width w, spaced a distance s apart, 
inside a pair of
groundplanes of  separation H. This has an exact analytical
answer, when the inner is infinitely thin and the overall width W is infinitely
wide. This theoretical impedance is calculated and printed to stderr if:
.br
a) The -v option is given on make_coupler's command line. AND
.br
b) make_coupler was linked against the gsl library at http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/

The overall width W is calculated internally to be large enough that
making it any larger will have negligable effect on the results.
The dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.
.PP 
.br
The bitmaps produced by \fBmake_coupler\fR are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as are required by \fBatlc\fR. Currenly make_coupler only produces bitmaps with
white (vacuum) dielectrics.

.br
\fB-b bitmapsize\fR
.br
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy to which atlc
is able to calculate the coupler's properties. The default
value for 'bitmapsize' is normally 18 although this can be set at
compile time. (see 'DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE' in definitions.h). The value can be set anywhere from 6 to 28. The size of bitmap produced will be
between 2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1), so if its set to 28 the
bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb, which would take an eternity to
compute. 
.PP
\fB-v \fR
.br
Print some extra data to stderr on the theoetical impedance of the
structure. This is useful to compare with the numerical result from
\fBatlc\fR
.SH EXAMPLES

In the first example, a standard coupler is created, where the 


eg1. make_coupler  1.23 0.7 1.2 1. >   coupler.bmp
e.g. make_coupler -b 8 1.23 0.7 1.2 >  small.bmp   (small bitmap produced)
e.g. make_coupler -v 12 1.23 0.7 1.2 >  theory.bmp  (prints info to stderr)
