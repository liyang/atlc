********************Version 4.1.6  Released  22/12/02 ********************
Made it more obvious there is a bug that prevents the use of atlc
where there is more than one dielectric on a directional coupler.

Updated the documentation so removing references to make_coupler

Changed the atlc homepage a bit, as it was out of date. 

********************Version 4.1.4  Released  15/12/02 ********************
Corrected bug found in design_coupler.c that prevented it compiling
under old versions of gcc. 

Added a few more tests that fail if gsl is not included. 

Updated the documentation. Some showed the output from 
atlc 2.x, which was a lot less accurate than 4.x.

Added a line for pth in Makefile.am. Threads on machines
othe than Solaris still needs some work. 

Added the file 'IMPORTANT.html' back into the release. For
some reason this got lost and was not present in any recent 
release, despite being on the web page and still valid.

Updated the FAQ, as some information was out of date.

********************Version 4.1.1  Released  14/12/02 ********************
**************************************************************************

Changed the default number of threads a mutli-threaded version of the
prorgram runs from 2 to 4, as I now own a quad processor machine. It is
changed in definitions.h

The program 'make_coupler' has been renamed to generate_coupler_bitmap,
as it never really did make a coupler, but only generate a bitmap for
one with the dimensions you gave. 

Added a new program 'design_coupler' which is very able. It can find the
required odd and even mode impedances given the coupling factor and
frequency range, and then design you a coupler with the right
dimensions!

Added much better documentation to support the directional couplers. New
files 'calculate_zodd_and_zeven.html',
'determine_dimensions_of_couplers.html' have been created. 

No significant changes have taken place to the code for two conductor
lines. I still need to address the problem of consistancy amoungst some
of the programs. 

A new directory 'tests' has been set up and automake configured such
that running 'make check' now performms a lot of checks and creates
all the examples. 

********************Version 4.0.1  Released  21/4/02 *********************
**************************************************************************

Added copyright notices to all files and added a -C option on all 
binaries to print out information on copyright. 

Corrected an error in READED.threads, since it refered to the -p options
for number of processors, which I later changed to -t threads to be more
accurate. 

Added my e-mail addres to the AUTHORS file. 

Update the TODO list. 

Remvoed the printing of L and C in the documentation (frontpage.html and
index2.html) for couplers, as these are mode-dependant and so one value
is not enough. 

Added a CVS entry on the banner page. 

Spent some time spell checking many of the html documents. 

Made some changes in the rect_in.. circ_in.. so that the integer values
create on a machine should be exactly the same on each machine. It was
possible before that some numbers would be generated on one machine and
some on another, due to rounding errors. This hopefully stops that. 

Changed src/non_gui/tests to point out what a dodgy gcc does. 

Added a few scrips 'tests' in other directories to src/non_gui, since
someone was looking for them and could not find them. Hence I've tried to
make it a bit clearer. 

********************Version 4.0.0 Released 11/4/02  *********************
**************************************************************************
Put a bit more info in the README.windows
Removed check for "intelligent life" in configure.in, as this was not working
with autoconf 2.13.

Added a function do_fd_calculation() and therefore added the file
do_fd_calculation.c This helps clean up atlc.c a lot, since a lot of
repetition has been removed. It needed quite a bit in it to handle the
case of coupled lines and all the different things that have to be
printed in this case. 

Changed setup_arrays.c so that it now sets a variable 'coupler' to TRUE
if there is a blue ( - 1 V) conductor. 

Got resuls out from the coupler. No idea if they are right. Pretty sure
they are wrong in fact. 

Corrected a typo in FAQ.html which meant the local copy of the QEX
paper could not be downloaded from the FAQ.

Answered that loss can't be measured in the FAQ.

Wrote a programme 'make_coupler' which writes a bitmap with two striplines 
between two parallel groundplanes as below.

------------^------------------------------------------------------------------
            |                                               
            |              <---w---><-----s----><---w-->
            H              ---------            --------
            |                                      
            |                               
------------v------------------------------------------------------------------
This has an exact analystical solution, so the file calculate_Zodd_and_Zeven.c
was created to find the exact theoretical values. This makes it possible
to compare the theory with atlc.

I got the equations from an e-mail sent to me by AA1LL / KB1CZP 
<aa1ll@email.com>. This required elliptic integrals, so its necessary to
link into the GNU scientific library, gsl to use it fully, although the
bitmap will be generated without the library.

Added information to accuracy.html on accuaracy with coupled lines. 

Changed finite_difference_multi_threaded.c & finite_difference_multi_threaded.c
to handle correctly the case of coupled lines - at least for vacuum
dielectric. 

Added a couple of tests in the file 'tests' to check the coupler 
related items. 


********************Version 3.0.7 Dated 6/4/2002**************************
**************************************************************************
Corrected the file man/makehtml, as it was not making an html page for
rect_cen_in_rect from the rect_cen_in_rect.1 man page. 

Put an error number each time a programme exits, so it is clear what
error caused it. 

Made a set of diectories called 'binaries' and subdirectories from that.
Please the latest Windows executables in binaries/Windows. 

Changed the line 
image_data=ustring(0L,width*height*3); in atlc.c
to
image_data=ustring(0L,size);
 
Removed all references to stdio.h and math.h in all files, since they
are included in definitions.h

Changed the line 
if( (image_data_fp=fopen(output_filename, "r")) == NULL)
to 
if( (image_data_fp=fopen(output_filename, "rb")) == NULL)
in atlc.c, so the bitmap is opened as a binary in Windoze.

put the line 
if((fp=fopen(temp,"w+b"))==NULL) instead of 
if((fp=fopen(temp,"w+b"))==NULL)
in get_file_pointer_with_right_filename.c
as the bitmaps were screwed up when written to disk in text mode, which
was happening under Windoze. 

Used a more complex method suggested by AD5GB to get open the bitmap
file for reading. I don't see why it should be necessary, but it keeps
Windows happy. 

defined M_PI if not already done so in definitions.h

Changed malloc call to a calloc in string.h

Corrected an error in the docs where it said in accuracy.html that the
error was 1.8% on the bottom of a table. That may have been so, but it
is a lot better now. 


********************Version 3.0.6 Dated 3/4/2002*************************
**************************************************************************
(note there was no release 3.0.5, as it got screwed up going up to
Sourceforge, after which is is impossible to overwrite the file). 


Removed all reference to the voltage v and instead replaced these by
Vij. The reason being that  Randall DuCharme <ad5gb@yahoo.com> has
advised me that the symbol v is defined in IBM's AIX operating sysytem.
Hence it would not compile without some hacking. 

Since the voltage is now called Vij, it makes sense for its indices to
be i and j and not w and h. Hence I've replaced at least some of the
v[j][h] to v[i][j]. 

Changed reference to longs and replaced by ints in write_bitmap_out.c,
since it was clear the longs would break it on 64-bit machines. 

Checked atlc one my Sun Ultra 60 with a 64-bit compiler using Sun's CC
compiler. All was okay and the generated bitmaps looked fine. 

Found a problem on the Sourforge Compile Farm with the programme
sym_strip. It crashed at the last but one line, where these is
flose(fp). Put in code to check if the file pointer was valid. This
can't be a bad thing, but it did not solve the problem. 

Another bug spotted on Sourceforge's compile farm. rect_in_rect,
circ_in_circ, circ_in_rect, and beadbin (but not atlc) all declare 
a character q, then use
q=get_options
whereas get_options returns an int, not a character. I don't know why the 
compiler does not spot that one. Anyway, it caused get_options to loop forever. 

All programme now seem to run okay on drkirkby@usf-cf-ppc-linux-1:,
which is a linux powered PowerPC RS6000. Not attempted compileing
multi-threaded. 


Attempted compiling on the Sourceforge Sun Ultra 60. This is the same as
my machine, so one might expect it to work okay. In fact, atlc 
compiles and runs okay on every machine tests (Dec Alpha, Suns
running Solaris, Suns running linux, linux PC, ... 

Correct typo, where it said 'is is' in usage_sym_strip.c

Changed the order and name or parameters in rect_cen_in_rect, so
it now

% rect_cen_in_rect W H w h Er1  > filename.bmp

Changed man page to suite. It was silly before. 

Removed note in the bitmap generators (rect_in_rect, circ_in_circ etc)
about piping into atlc, since atlc does not support reading from 
standard input. 

Changed circ_in_circ so the information it can provide about theoretical
impedances is only produced if the -v flag is given. 

corrected usage_circ_in_rect.c, as information at the bottom on usage
was all wrong. 

Added a test suite in the script src/tests. I might well add a version of
sum to the distribution, as it appears to be implementation dependant. 

Removed #include <malloc.h> as it is depricated according to gcc and
files compile fine without it. Also removed stddef.h from nrutil.c, as
that too is not needed. 

Changed the names of the variables opterr, optind, optopt and optarg to be
my_opterr, my_optind, my_optopt and my_optarg in get_options.c This is to
avoid a warning from one of the compilers (I think on a Mac) about the fact
that it is defined elsewhere. 


********************Version 3.0.4 Dated 1/4/2002*************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE 3.0.3 never released, since the upload to sourceforge failed. 

Corrected bug in write_fields.c which caused a crash under Linux
(as reported by Randall DuCharme <ad5gb@yahoo.com>) and With 
Borland C++ builder on my SunPCi card. 

Corrected a bug in atlc.c, which was causing a crash on the SunPCi
card and possibly a crash (not yet confirmed) under Solaris on 
a Sun Ultra 30 belonging to Randall DuCharme <ad5gb@yahoo.com>

Added an option to atlc.c to avoid writing the bitmap files. 

Corrected a bug in readbin.c, which caused it to report any 
number >.99 as a one, when it might well be METAL_ER. Also checked more
carefully for -1 V, by only looking from -0.999999999 to - 1.000000000001

Added the following lines to readbin and atlc.c, which are necessary
when compiling with C++ Builder version 3. I need to do likewise to the
rect_in_rect etc, but for now I have not. 

#ifdef WINDOWS
#pragma hrdstop
#include <condefs.h>
#endif

(I need to define WINDOWS when compiling on Windoze).

Corrected usage_atlc so it now does not take the filename, but knows it
is atlc. 

Added (void) to the defintion of any function that takes no arguments. I
found that while gcc is happy to accept a fuction with an argument that is
declared like this:
int somefunction()
Borland C++ Builder was not happy with that. Hence I now declare functions
as taking void when they don't take argments. This keeps Borland C++
builder happy and allows for stricter checking with gcc. 

Added a piece of code 'get_options.c' which was necessary since 
Borland C++ Builder does not have such a function.  

Stopped print_data taking an argument 'version' and then reading it from
VERSION. It now just reads from VERSION

Remved 'ER' from check_for_boundaries.c and all references to it, which
were all in comments. The Borland C++ Builder is better at spotting such
problems than gcc, so is Sun's C compiler. 

Added code to check if the upper number (eg nh) is less than or equal to
the lower number (eg nl) in functions free_* in files nrutuil.c and
string.c This stops the Borland C++ Builder complaining about the
arguments not being used and also does some sanity checking. 

********************Version 3.0.2 Dated 30/3/2002*************************
**************************************************************************
Fixed a problem with the Makefile.am's which meant not all the files were 
included and the sym_strip.1 was spelt wrong. 

********************Version 3.0.1 Dated 29/3/2002*************************
**************************************************************************
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCURACY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCURACY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCURACY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In a comparisson of 3 analytic models (coax, eccentric coax and
stripline), and 31 tests (roughly a third of each), the maximum error
was only 0.945 % and the RMS error is only 0.259 %. The programme now
undereads more than overreads, so I still think there may be a
systematic error, but any problems are now very small. Despite the fact
atlc is supporting multiple dielectrics, I've not managed to find any
models with exact analytic solutions to compare against atlc. When
calculationg the E-field across a dielectric, the method used does not
properly consider a boundary between two dielectrics. Hence I can expect
the error with multiple dielectrics to be a bit higher than with one.
This will be sorted out later. 

Added a man page for sym_strip and updated all other man pages. Keeping
the documentation up to date is a problem. 

Since many of the bitmaps used in the examples are large, I decided to
not bother distributing them all, but instead write a script 'create' to
make them. 'create' may be found in both  the examples and src
directories. 

Added a small script 'makehtml' in man, to create easily html version of
the man pages. 

It was necessary to take into account when a dielectric is next to
metal, as otherwise the E-fields calculated in the dielectric are in
erro when next to metal. This is done. check_for_boundaries.c has been changed
to indicate whether a dielectric has metal to the left, right, above or
below it.  

function calculate_colour_data() added to calculate the colour a pixel
should be set to - this is called by write_fields(). 

Added a file find_electric_fields.c, which has 3 functions in it -
find_Ex(), find_Ey() and find_E(). This avoids different parts of the
programme using different definitions for Ex, Ey and E. 

Changed write_fields almost completely. It now prints more files
and uses less ram, as not all the data is stored before writing to 
disk. Now only one set is stored in ram before writing to disk.
This is a bit slower, but it will save a lot of ram. 

After thinking about it a lot, I feel it is necessary to change the -1 V
conductor (which has never been used) from black to blue. Since I've
stated before that black is -1 V and blue is a dielectric with a
permittivity of 2.1, this is a bit annoying. However, it seems illogical
to have a negative electric field shown as blue, and negative voltages
as blue, yet have -1 V as black. Hence the definition of -1 V is changed
and another colour (a light blue) has been selected to reprsent the
permittivity of PTFE. 

Made a significant improvement to accuracy, but using the following
defintion for Ex
Ex=0.5*(v[i+1][j]-v[i-1][j]);
but changing it a bit when at a boundary with metal. i.e.
if((cell_type[i][j]&METAL_LEFT)==METAL_LEFT)
  Ex=(v[i+1][j]-v[i][j]);
Same is done in an obvious manner for Ey and the right hand side. This
has made a significant improvement to accuracy, so html docs have been
re-written.

Changed the definition of Ex and Ey in write_fields.c, since they were
defined at dV/dx, and dV/dy, but the electric field is defined as the
reverse of that. i.e. ex=-dV/dx and Ey is -dV/dy. 

Added some code in write_fields.c to print the energy (CV^2) too. 

********************Version 3.0.0 Dated 24/3/2002*************************
**************************************************************************
Added support for multiple dielectrics. More work needs to be done to
confirm the accuracy of this, but it is now working at least. 

Spent a lot of time thinking carefully about exactly where the voltage
are defined (top left of a pixel) and exactly where the E-field should
be calculated (centre of a pixel) and exactly what the E-field is. The
results seem no more accurate than before (still a small over-estimate
of Zo), but at least it should give anyone else chance to find a fault.
Before it was too obvious that a few problems remained on exactly what
happens on a boundardy. 

Programme should be able to cope with 4 different dielectrics in a
square - i.e. it can be really arbitrary. 

Changed the value of r in atlc.c from 1.5 to 1.95. This has made a HUGE
INCREASE IN SPEED!!! The programme is now about 6x quicker than before.

Added a function check_for_boundaries(), which looks for changes of
index and metals around a pixel. Its not really used now, but it has the
potential for speeding the code up, since it can avoid a lot of checking
every time the FD loop executes. It makes sence to do the checking once
and use those results. 

Removed all C++ commments, as this would stop it compiling on a C
compiler. One of the Sun compilers I have is only C. 

Added a file 'fd.c' which is not in the makefile. It is included in the
C functions finite_difference_*.c. It is better to use it like this
rather than put the code inline, for speed reasons. It is called several
times. Putting it in one file insures all the times its called are
calling exactly the same code. It is too easy to have errors otherwise.



Added a programme 'thin_strip; which produces a stipline like this:

          ------^-------------------------------------
                |
                H        -----w------
                |
-infinity ------v------------------------------------ +infinity

This has a well defined impedance, which is given in "Field Theory of Guided 
Waves", Colin R.E., 2nd edition, pp 259-273, IEEE Press, (1990).

I realised the programme was taking too much memory. Reading in a 24 Mb
bitmap, resulted in the programme using 179 Mb of RAM. It was discoverd
that the variable 'cell_type' defined in atlc, was an integer array,
when a character one would have done, saving 3 bytes per pixel of RAM. I
Added functions charmatrix and freecharmatrix in nrutil.c, for allocation
and dealocation of the matrix.

Removed the '-m' option from usage_atlc.c, since the option no longer
worked - it was removed some time ago. 

Removed the '-F' option from usage_atlc.c, since the option  did not 
work. I decided not to bother fixing it, but instead of writing data
to a user-specified file name, write it to example.txt, when the 
bitmap file is example.bmp. 

Removed the handling of option 'h' in atlc.c, since the option no longer
existed. 

Printed a messge with usage_atlc, so that it indicated that if
multi-processor support was not compiled into atlc. 

Added a few commments are correct a few typos in other commments, in the
file finite_difference_multi_threaded.c

Checked the system reasonably well with multi-threading enabled on my
dual preocessor Sun Ultra 60. The programme speeds up quite a bit,
depending on the size of the job. Certainly runing with two threads
(either by defining #define MAX_CPUS 2 in definintions.h, or the -p2
command line option, seem to work best for my dual processor machine. Running
a few more threads (up to 5 or so) does not slow the system much, but as
more and more are added, there is a definate slowdown. 

renamed usage to usage_atlc, to be consistant with all the other
programmes (usage_rect_in_rect etc) 

Added quit a few comments to atlc.c, and generally made the code tidier,
with more consistant indenting. 

Added a file/function swap_conductor voltages, which converts +1V to -1V
and visa-versa. This is needed to compute the impedance of coupled
lines. 

**************************Version 2.32 Dated 9/3/2002***************************
********************************************************************************
Wrote manpage for readbin
Moved man page from man to man/man1.
Removed function free_ucmatrix, free_ucmatrix and byteswap, none of which
were used. 
Added a new ability to calculate Zo assuming a round conductor - which
it might not be. Its useful to check the software against coax, which
has well defined values. Needs -v option to see the result. 
Added a new programme (only one file) 'readbin' which analyses the .bin
files and reports on the number of each colour pixel. 
Corrected write_fields.c, so that a conductor is printed with zero
E-field. Sometimes this was not so, as there was no check before writing
the E-fields out that the pixels was not a conductor. 
Added new file/function check_for_shorts(), which causes the programme to
exit if a conductor of one voltage is in contact with a conductor of
another voltage. 
Compiled with Sun's CC compiler, which threw up a few prolems. It's more
fussy that gcc!!  Hence made these changes:
a) Replaced strncmp(bitmap_file_buffer, with strncmp((char *)
   bitmap_file_buffer, on line 41 of read_bitmap_file_headers.c. 
b) Changed atlc.c so a fread((void *)... image_data from fread(image_data...
c) Removed multiple declaration of some variables in rect_in_rect.c,
circ_in_circ.c
d) Changed fill_image_vector_with_data in rect_in_rect.c,
rect_in_circ.c, circ_in_circ.c circ_in_rect.c and definitions.h, such
that the first argument is an unsigned char *, not char*  as before. 
e) align_bitmap_image in align_bitmap_image.c changed so its arguments
are unsigned *char, not *char as before. Updated header file to reflect
this. 
f) 

In several C files, changed variables so they were initialised to -1 - it stops
compiler complaining about possible use of unitialisd variables. 
Removed multi-line fprintf statement, and made into two statements in rect_in_circ.c
Changed else if(j=D/2) to else if(j==D/2) in fill_rect_in_circ.c
Added exit(0) to end of circ_in_circ.c
Added exit(0) to end of circ_in_rect.c
Added exit(0) to end of rect_in_circ.c
Added definition of usage_circ_in_rect() to definitions.h 

Removed the note about version 2.4 from this ChangeLog, as it wasn't released. 
Corrected a serious bug in setup_arrays.c, where v was set to 0.3 instead of 0 V. 
Removed 'byteswap' from byteswap.c and definitions.h
Added code in configure.in to enable -Wall with gcc.


************Version 2.2 Dated 2/12/2001**************
*****************************************************
Changed some of the html documentation, to be more in line with the
source and man pages. 

Verion 2.1 Dated 1/12/2001
Many updates to documentation:
Added man pages for rect_cen_in_rect
Added man pages for circ_in_rect
Added man pages for rect_in_rect
Added man pages for circ_in_circ

Added binaries for:
rect_cen_in_rect
circ_in_rect
circ_in_circ
rect_in_circ - this dones NOT work, so it is configured to always exit.

Changed atlc so that it no longer uses the faster convergence algorithm.
I now know it can fail, so will remove it. 

Changed usage.c and atlc.c so that the -p option is not displayed if not 
MP enabled.
usage.c Changed the usage message about '-i fiddle' as it was wrong before, in assuming default to be
1.
atlc.c Added a '-c' option, to change the cutoff. 
atlc.c Changed the reading of the '-i fiddle' option, so its read a double and not a long

25/4/2001, verison 2.01 put on SorgeForce unix only, supports multiple
CPUs. 

Version 1.09 - Windows verison, put on my web site.

Version 1 - published in QEX, see qex-december-1996/atlc.pdf.
