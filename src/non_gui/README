IMPORTANT - A number of example files are provided in the form of bitmaps
(.bmp's). Since bitmap files are quite large and there are probrams that
can generate at least some examples with little effort, not all the 
example files are distributed. 

The files ending in .bmp.txt are the result of running atlc
on each of the bitmaps. So this would be run ' atlc x.bmp > x.bmp.txt'

The following output files are of zero length, since running atlc generates
an error message (quite correclty) if its run with no arguments on the 
corresponding bitmap files. 

aliased.bmp.txt
an_odd_er.bmp.txt
enclosed-microstrip.bmp.txt
ex2.bmp.txt
odd-coupler.bmp.txt

The following 3 files are of zero length, since the corresponding bitmaps
have shorts and so should only output to stderr, not stdout. 
ground-negative-short.bmp.txt
positive-ground-short.bmp.txt
positive-negative-short.bmp.txt

The theoeritical impedances of some of these are listed in the
documentation in atlc-x.y.z/html-docs/accuracy.html

Note that the files with striplines in have the stripline only one pixel
high, placed centrally at the interface between the lower and upper
conductors. You will probably need to zoom in a lot to see it. The same
goes for the pcb type files - the strip is very thin.
