The 'sum' command is used to generate a checksum, which is used in the file
'tests' to check for consistancy of files. The version used when developing
the tests was the GNU

sum (GNU textutils) 1.22

Sun's implementation is different, so would indicate all tests have failed,
when in fact it just means the sum command is different.  

This file is used as a test file, with a known checkum. If the 'sum'
command does not agree on the checksum for this file, then the version of
'sum' is not suitable.
